        <h2> Overview </h2>
        <p>The Animal Disease Spread Model (ADSM) is a software application that simulates the spread of highly contagious animal diseases in a susceptible population. Applied control measures can influence the disease outbreak. ADSM features upgraded technology and a redesigned user interface combined with the trusted logic of NAADSM </p>

        <h2>Applications</h2>
        <li> Evaluate proposed disease control strategies for planning and policy decisions. </li>
            <p></p>
        <li> Provide “what if” scenarios for outbreak planning exercises. </li>
            <p></p>
        <li> Estimate consequences as part of the risk analysis process. </li>
            <p></p>
        <li> Assess the potential economic impacts of disease and associated control measures. </li>
            <p></p>
        <li> Provide input for emergency preparedness and surveillance plans and activities. </li>
            <p></p>
        <li> Create simple scenarios for an educational setting or complex scenarios for policy research. </li>
            <p></p>
        <li> Communicate principles of epidemiology and disease control. </li>
            <p></p>
        <li> Support researchers who incorporate disease modeling in their work. </li>
            <p></p>
        <li> Explore questions related to resources needed in the event of an outbreak. </li>
            <p></p>
        <li> Offer outreach and training in the use of disease models in general, and of ADSM in particular, to scientific and veterinary communities. </li>
            <p></p>

        <h2>Key Characteristics</h2>
        <li> ADSM is herd based. Disease manifestation and transmission are represented at the level of a herd/flock of animals, rather than at the individual animal level. </li>
        <p></p>
        <li> ADSM is a state transition model. Each infected herd transitions from a susceptible state to and infected state and back to an immune state. </li>
        <p></p>
        <li> ADSM is a stochastic simulation. It mimics the random processes responsible for disease spread. Each simulated outbreak is the result of a unique series of random events and processes. When analyzed together, many simulated outbreaks represent a range of possible outcomes, given a set of shared assumption. </li>
        <p></p>
        <li> ADSM simulates spatial and temporal aspects of disease spread. Each herd in a scenario is assigned a physical location and disease progression occurs in daily time steps. </li>
