.\" This program may also be used in an MPI environment if MPI was enabled during its compilation.

.SH "NAME"
.LP 
spreadmodel \- Runs epidemiological simulations for animal populations
.SH "SYNTAX"
.LP 
spreadmodel [\fIoption\fP] \-h <population\-file> <\fIscenario\-file\fP>

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
This program is part of the SpreadModel, software suite, which can be downloaded from http://
.br 


.SH "OPTIONS"
.LP 
These options are not required unless otherwise specified in their descriptions.  Many of these options depend on the actual build of the simulation engine, and which options were selected during the compilation configuration process.
.LP 
.TP 
\fB\-m\fR <\fIdirectory\fP>
Uses the model libraries in <\fIdirectory\fP> to dynamically load models as needed.  This option is only valid if the program was compiled to use dynamic libraries, otherwise it is ignored.
.TP 
\fB\-V\fR <\fIlevel\fP>
Sets the program output verbosity to <\fIlevel\fP> where 
.br 
0 means simulation output data ONLY
.br 
1 means 0 + informational messages 
.br 
2 means 1 + verbose debugging output.  
.br 
This option is only valid if the program was compiled with the \-\-enable\-debug or \-\-enable\-info switches set, and for the integer level values of 0, 1, or 2 .
.TP 
\fB\-o\fR <\fIfile\fP>
Specifies an output file, <\fIfile\fP>, to use, in which to store the resulting output, i.e. result, data, and any messages enabled with the \-V option.  If no file is specified, the output is sent to stdout.
.TP 
\fB\-p\fR  <\fIextended\-input\fP>
This option specifies a file, which contains extended input configuration information for use by the simulator, when it is compiled using the \-\-enable\-sc\-guilib functionality.  This additional information is required in order to generate the SQL output data enabled by the \-\-enable\-sc\-guilib configuration switch.  When this option is enabled, the output of the simulator is SQL insert and update statements for a MySQL database, and is all saved in the file specified by the \-o option or to stdout when that option is not specified.  If the program was not compiled using the \-\-enable\-sc\-guilib configuration switch, this option has no affect.
.TP 
\fB\-\-help\fR OR \fB\-\-usage\fR
Prints a short description of the program commandline options and its usage.
.TP 
\fB\-\-version\fR [Not implemented]
Output version information and exit.
.SH "FILES"
.LP 
If the dynamic model library loading method was selected during compilation, this program relies on the dynamic model libraries located in the directory specified by the builder.  By default this is /usr/local/models .
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.LP 
To run this program the standard way type:
.br 
spreadmodel \-h /home/me/population.xml \-m /home/me/models \-V0 \-o /home/me/results.txt  /home/me/scenario.xml
.LP 
.br 
Using standard MPI:
.br 
mpirun \-n 20 /home/me/bin/spreadmodel \-h /home/me/population.xml \-m /home/me/models \-V0 \-o /home/me/results.txt  /home/me/scenario.xml
