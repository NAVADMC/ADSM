    accompany infectiousness immediately, and immunity lasts 1 day.
    
    The probability of detection vs. the number of days a unit has been showing
    clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The probability of detection vs. the number
    of days since a public announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.
    
    The authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The
    authorities can destroy an unlimited/very large number of units each day.
    
    There is no spread or vaccination.

    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
     - On day 1 the unit will be Latent.
     - On day 2 the unit will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected and
       marked for destruction.
     - On day 3 the unit will be destroyed.  Its state will appear as Destroyed

  <description>
    Test that the probability of detection can be influenced by days since the
    1st detection.  In this two-unit scenario, the probability of detection vs.
    days since the 1st detection starts low and increases 1 day after the first
    detection.  The probability of detection vs. days showing clinical signs is
    constant for both production types.  For unit 0, this probability is high
    enough to trigger a detection with the baseline (pre-1st detection)
    probability.  For unit 1, the probability of detection vs. days showing
    clinical signs is low enough that it requires the increase in public
    awareness to push the combined probability over the threshold for
    detection.

  <description>
    Test that the probability of detection can be influenced by days since the
    1st detection.  In this two-unit scenario, the probability of detection vs.
    days since the 1st detection starts low and increases 1 day after the first
    detection.  The probability of detection vs. days showing clinical signs is
    constant for both production types.  For unit 0, this probability is high
    enough to trigger a detection with the baseline (pre-1st detection)
    probability.  For unit 1, the probability of detection vs. days showing
    clinical signs is low enough that it requires the increase in public
    awareness to push the combined probability over the threshold for
    detection.

  <parameter-description>
    For cattle (unit 0), the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness lasts 5
    days, clinical signs accompany infectiousness immediately, and immunity
    lasts 3 days.  For pigs (unit 1), the latent period lasts 1 day,
    infectiousness without clinical signs lasts 1 day, infectiousness with
    clinical signs lasts 5 days, and immunity lasts 3 days.

    For cattle, the probability of detection vs. the number of days a unit has
    been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1.  For pigs, the probability of
    detection vs. the number of days a unit has been showing clinical signs is
    fixed at 0.6.  The probability of detection vs. the number of days since a
    public announcement of an outbreak (for both production types) is 0.55 on
    "day 0" (the baseline before the 1st detection) and day 1 (the day after
    the 1st detection), then is 1.0 on day 2 and later.

    The authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The
    authorities can destroy an unlimited/very large number of units each day.

    There is no spread or vaccination.

    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
     - On day 1 both units will be Latent.
     - On day 2 unit 0 (cattle) will be Infectious Clinical.  The probability
       of detection = the baseline before the 1st detection (0.55) times the
       value for day 1 of the clinical period (1.0) = 0.55.  Unit 0 will be
       detected and marked for destruction.  Unit 1 will be Infectious
       Subclinical.
     - On day 3 unit 0 will be destroyed.  Unit 1 (pigs) will be Infectious
       Clinical.  The probability of detection = the value for 1 day since the
       1st detection (0.55) times the value for day 1 of the clinical period
       (0.6) = 0.33.  With "fixed" random numbers of 0.5, this is too low for
       detection.  Unit 1 will not be detected.
     - On day 4 the probability of detection for unit 1 (pigs) = the value for
       2 days since the 1st detection (1.0) times the value for day 2 of the
       clinical period (0.6) = 0.6.  Unit 1 will be detected and marked for
       destruction.
     - On day 5 unit 1 will be destroyed.

  <parameter-description>
    For both production types, the latent period lasts 1 day, the infectious
    clinical period lasts 4 days, and immunity lasts 4 days.

    The movement rate from pig units to cattle units is fixed at 1 shipment
    each day.  There is no movement in the other direction.  Latent units
    cannot be the source of an infection.

    For unit 1 (a pig unit), the probability of detection is 0 on the first and
    second days showing clinical signs, and 1 on following days.  In this set
    of scenarios, this parameter is used to control when trace is initiated.

    For unit 0 (a cattle unit), the probability of detection is 1/3, which is
    always too low for detection when using fixed "random" numbers of 0.5.
    This parameter is set this way so that any detection we see will be the
    result of an exam as part of the trace investigation, not from "regular"
    detection.

    When a unit is detected, trace out will be initiated.  The probability of
    success for a trace investigation is 1, and there is a 2-day delay for
    finding recipient units.  Units found by trace are quarantined, visually
    inspected (like regular detection, but with 2x the probability of
    detection) and tested for disease.  The test sensitivity and specificity
    are both 1.

    The authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The
    authorities can destroy an unlimited/very large number of units each day.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 unit 1 will be Latent.
     - On day 2 unit 1 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will ship to and
       infect unit 0.
     - On day 4 unit 0 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will not be detected,
       because the base probability of detection is too low.  However, unit 1
       will be detected on this day.  It will be slated for destruction and a
       trace out will be initiated.
     - On day 5 unit 1 will be destroyed (its state will show as destroyed on
       day 6).
     - On day 6 unit 0 will be found by tracing (2 days after the trace was
       initiated).  A visual inspection by experts, with its increased
       probability of detection, will show that unit 0 is diseased.  Unit 0
       will be slated for destruction.
     - On day 7 unit 0 will be destroyed.  Its state will show as destroyed on
       day 8.

       tracing (4 days after the trace was initiated).  A visual inspection by
       experts has a high enough probability to detect signs of disease, but
       because the unit has recovered, there will be no signs.  Samples will be
       taken for testing.
     - On day 10 the test results will be available and will show that unit 0
       still had antibodies at the time the test samples were taken.  Unit 0
       will be slated for destruction. 
     - On day 11 unit 0 will be destroyed.  Its state will show as destroyed on
       day 12.

    The parameters are identical to "trace RFC example 1a, check detection

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 unit 1 will be Latent.
     - On day 2 unit 1 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will ship to and
       infect unit 0.
     - On day 4 unit 0 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will not be detected,
       because the base probability of detection is too low.  However, unit 1
       will be detected on this day.  That is the overall first detection, the
       first detection of pigs, and the first detection by clinical signs.
     - On day 6 unit 0 will be found by tracing (2 days after the trace was
       initiated).  A visual inspection by experts, with its increased
       probability of detection, will show that unit 0 is diseased.  That is
       the first detection of cattle.

  <parameter-file>trace_rfc_example_7_exams</parameter-file>

  <parameter-description>
    For unit 2 (the unit that ships), the latent period lasts 1 day, the
    infectious clinical period lasts 4 days, and immunity lasts 4 days.  For
    unit 1 (the unit that receives the shipment), the latent period lasts 1
    day, the infectious clinical period lasts 4 days, and immunity lasts 4
    days.  For unit 0 (the unit that causes the destruction ring later in the
    scenario), the latent period lasts 2 days, the infectious clinical period
    lasts 4 days, and immunity lasts 4 days.

    The movement rate from pig units to cattle units is fixed at 1 shipment
    each day.  There is no movement in the other direction.  Latent units
    cannot be the source of an infection.

    For unit 2 (a pig unit), the probability of detection is 0 on the first day
    showing clinical signs, and 1 on following days.  In this set of scenarios,
    this parameter is used to control when trace is initiated.
    
    For unit 1 (a cattle unit), the probability of detection is 1/3, which is
    always too low for detection when using fixed "random" numbers of 0.5.
    This parameter is set this way so that any detection we see will be the
    result of an exam as part of the trace investigation, not from "regular"
    detection.
    
    There is no detection of sheep units.

    When a unit is detected, trace out will be initiated.  The probability of
    success for a trace investigation is 1, and there is a 2-day delay for
    finding recipient units.  Units found by trace are quarantined, visually
    inspected (like regular detection, but with 2x the probability of
    detection) and tested for disease.  Test results take 3 days.  The test
    sensitivity and specificity are both 1.

    The authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The
    authorities can destroy an unlimited/very large number of units each day.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 units 0 and 2 will be Latent.
     - On day 2 unit 2 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will ship to and infect
       unit 1.
     - On day 3 units 0 and 2 will be detected.  They will be slated for
       destruction and a trace out will be initiated.  Unit 1 will also be
       slated for destruction because it is within 12 km of unit 0.
     - On day 4 units 0, 1 and 2 will be destroyed (their state will show as
       destroyed on day 5).
     - On day 5 unit 1 will be found by tracing (2 days after the trace was
       initiated).  However, the unit is already destroyed, so there is no
       possibility of detecting signs that it was once diseased, or of doing
       further traces.  No exam will be counted.

    The parameters are identical to "trace RFC example 1a, check detection
    reasons" above.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 unit 1 will be Latent.
     - On day 2 unit 1 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will ship to and
       infect unit 0.
     - On day 4 unit 0 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will not be detected,
       because the base probability of detection is too low.  However, unit 1
       will be detected on this day.  It will be slated for destruction and a
       trace out will be initiated.
     - On day 5 unit 1 will be destroyed (its state will show as destroyed on
       day 6).
     - On day 6 unit 0 will be found by tracing (2 days after the trace was
       initiated).  A visual inspection by experts, with its increased
       probability of detection, will show that unit 0 is diseased.  Because a
       visual exam was sufficient to detect disease, no test will be ordered.
       Unit 0 will be slated for destruction.
     - On day 7 unit 0 will be destroyed.  Its state will show as destroyed on
       day 8.

  <parameter-description>
    The parameters are identical to "trace RFC example 2, check detection
    reasons" above.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 unit 1 will be Latent.
     - On day 2 unit 1 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will ship to and
       infect unit 0.
     - On day 4 unit 0 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will not be detected,
       because the base probability of detection is too low.  However, unit 1
       will be detected on this day.  That is the overall first detection, the
       first detection of pigs, and the first detection by clinical signs.
     - On day 8 unit 0 will be Naturally Immune.  Unit 0 will be found by
       tracing (4 days after the trace was initiated).  A visual inspection by
       experts has a high enough probability to detect signs of disease, but
       because the unit has recovered, there will be no signs.  Samples will be
       taken for testing.  We should count 1 cattle unit/25 animals tested,
       done because a direct contact was traced forward (DirFwd).
     - On day 10 the test results will be available and will show that unit 0
       still had antibodies at the time the test samples were taken.

    This is one of a group of scenarios to test the sensitivity and specificity

    but the test sensitivity is too low and the result will be negative.

  <parameter-description>
    For both production types, the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness
    without clinical signs lasts 1 day, infectiousness with clinical signs
    lasts 1 day, and immunity lasts 3 days.

    The movement rate from pig units to cattle units is fixed at 1 shipment per
    day.  The distance of shipments is fixed at 10 km.  The probability of
    infection given exposure is 1.  There is no movement in the other
    direction.

    Only pig units are detected.  The probability of detection vs. the number
    of days a unit has been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The
    probability of detection vs. the number of days since a public announcement
    of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    The authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The
    authorities can destroy an unlimited/very large number of units each day.

    The authorities do trace out only.  The probability of success for a
    trace-out investigation is 1, and there is no delay for getting trace
    results.  Units found by trace are quarantined and tested.  The test
    sensitivity is 0.495, and the specificity is 1.  Units that test positive
    will be destroyed.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 the pig unit (unit 1) will be Latent.
     - On day 2 unit 1 will be Infectious Subclinical.  It will ship to and
       infect unit 0.
     - On day 3 unit 1 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected and
       marked for destruction.  A trace out from unit 1 will find unit 0.
       Unit 0 will be Latent, but the test sensitivity is too low to detect it,
       so unit 0 will not be marked for destruction.
     - On day 4 unit 1 will be destroyed.  Its state will appear as Destroyed
       on day 5.

  <parameter-description>
    For both production types, the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness
    without clinical signs lasts 1 day, infectiousness with clinical signs
    lasts 1 day, and immunity lasts 3 days.

    The movement rate from pig units to cattle units is fixed at 1 shipment per
    day.  The distance of shipments is fixed at 10 km.  The probability of
    infection given exposure is 1.  There is no movement in the other
    direction.

    Only pig units are detected.  The probability of detection vs. the number
    of days a unit has been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The
    probability of detection vs. the number of days since a public announcement
    of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    The authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The
    authorities can destroy an unlimited/very large number of units each day.

    The authorities do trace out only.  The probability of success for a
    trace-out investigation is 1, and there is a 2-day delay for getting trace
    results.  Units found by trace are quarantined and tested.  The test
    sensitivity is 0.505, and the specificity is 1.  Units that test positive
    will be destroyed.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 the pig unit (unit 1) will be Latent.
     - On day 2 unit 1 will be Infectious Subclinical.  It will ship to and
       infect unit 0.
     - On day 3 unit 1 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected and
       marked for destruction.  A trace out will be requested from unit 1.
       Unit 0 will be Latent.
     - On day 4 unit 1 will be destroyed.  Its state will appear as Destroyed
       on day 5.
     - On day 5 the trace requested on day 3 will find unit 0, which is
       clinical, and the test will detect it, so unit 0 will be marked for
       destruction.
     - On day 6 unit 0 will be destroyed.  Its state will appear as Destroyed
       on day 7.

  <description>
    This is one of a group of scenarios to test the sensitivity and specificity
    parameters for tests.  In this scenario, the unit found by trace is
    Destroyed.  We want to make sure that no test occurs for a Destroyed unit,
    which is functionally equivalent to a negative result.

    This scenario has 3 units, numbered 0, 1, and 2.  0 ships to 1 and 1 ships
    to 2.  The unit that a test may be attempted on is unit 1, in the middle.
    We can tell whether a test occurs and comes up positive because a positive
    test will trigger a further trace out to unit 2.

    This scenario is a baseline to establish that trace out will cause unit 2
    to be destroyed if unit 1 tests positive.

    The rate of direct contacts from sheep units to cattle units is fixed at 1

    units is fixed at 1 shipment per day.  The distance of contacts is fixed at
    10 km.  The probability of infection given exposure is 1.

    Only sheep units are detected.  The probability of detection vs. the number

     - On day 4 unit 0 will be destroyed.  Its state will appear as Destroyed
       on day 5.
     - On day 6 the trace requested on day 3 will find unit 1.  This is the
       important day to watch when comparing this scenario to the next one.
       Unit 1 will be tested, and because it is infectious clinical, the test
       will be positive.  Unit 1 will be marked for destruction and a trace out
       will be requested.
     - On day 7 unit 1 will be destroyed.  Its state will appear as Destroyed
       on day 8.
     - On day 9 the trace requested on day 6 will find unit 2, which is now
       Infectious Clinical.  Unit 2 will be tested and found to be diseased.
       Unit 2 will be marked for destruction.
     - On day 10 unit 2 will be destroyed.  Its state will appear as Destroyed
       on day 11.

  <short-name>test, unit Destroyed</short-name>

  <description>
    This is one of a group of scenarios to test the sensitivity and specificity
    parameters for tests.  In this scenario, the unit found by trace is
    Destroyed.  We want to make sure that no test occurs for a Destroyed unit,
    which is functionally equivalent to a negative result.

    This scenario has 3 units, numbered 0, 1, and 2.  0 ships to 1 and 1 ships
    to 2.  The unit that a test may be attempted on is unit 1, in the middle.
    We can tell whether a test occurs and comes up positive because a positive
    test will trigger a further trace out to unit 2.

    In this scenario the unit in the middle is Destroyed at the time of the
    test, so trace out should not continue to unit 2.

  <parameter-description>
    For both production types, the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness
    without clinical signs lasts 1 day, infectiousness with clinical signs
    lasts 3 days, and immunity lasts 3 days.

    The rate of direct contacts from sheep units to cattle units is fixed at 1
    contact per day. The rate of indirect contacts from cattle units to pig
    units is fixed at 1 shipment per day.  The distance of contacts is fixed at
    10 km.  The probability of infection given exposure is 1.

    Only sheep units are detected.  The probability of detection vs. the number
    of days a unit has been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The
    probability of detection vs. the number of days since a public announcement
    of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    The authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The
    authorities can destroy 1 unit each day.

    The authorities do trace out only, not trace in.  The probability of
    success for a trace-out investigation is 1, and there is a 3-day delay for
    getting trace results.  Units found by trace are quarantined and tested.
    The test sensitivity and specificity are both 1.  Units that test positive
    will be destroyed.

    The authorities also do ring destruction.  All cattle units within 10 km of
    a detection will be destroyed.  Detected units have priority over units
    that are in a destruction ring.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 unit 0 will be Latent.
     - On day 2 unit 1 will be Infectious Subclinical.  It will ship to and
       infect unit 1, which will in turn infect unit 2 on day 4.
     - On day 3 unit 0 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected and
       marked for destruction.  A trace out will be requested from unit 0.
       Unit 1 will also be marked for destruction because it is a cattle unit
       within 10 km of a detection.
     - On day 4 units 0 and 1 are both marked for destruction, but unit 0 has
       priority, so it will be destroyed.  Its state will appear as Destroyed
       on day 5.
     - On day 5 unit 1 will be destroyed.
     - On day 6 the trace requested on day 3 will find unit 1.  The policy
       calls for unit 1 to be tested, but since unit 1 is destroyed, there is
       no need.  No trace out will happen.
     - On the remaining days the infection in unit 2 will run its course.

    This is one of a group of scenarios to test the counting of true positives,
    false negatives, etc. resulting from diagnostic tests.  In this scenario,
    the unit found by trace is not infected (it is susceptible), but the test

  <description>
    This is one of a group of scenarios to test the counting of true positives,
    false negatives, etc. resulting from diagnostic tests.  In this scenario,
    the unit found by trace is Destroyed.  We want to make sure that no test
    occurs for a Destroyed unit.

    This scenario has 3 units, numbered 0, 1, and 2.  0 ships to 1 and 1 ships
    to 2.  The unit that a test may be attempted on is unit 1, in the middle.
    In this scenario the unit in the middle is Destroyed at the time of the
    test, so a test should not occur.

    This scenario is a baseline to establish that a test would occur if unit 1
    were not Destroyed.

    For all production types, the latent period lasts 1 day, the infectious
    clinical period lasts 3 days, and immunity lasts 3 days.

    Pig units ship to sheep units once per day.  Sheep units ship to cattle
    units once per day.  Latent units cannot be the source of an exposure.
    The probability of infection given exposure is always too low to infect.

    The probability of detection for sheep and cattle units is too low for
    detection by self-reporting, but an exam can detect the unit any time
    during its clinical period.  Pig units will be detected by self-reporting
    on the second day they show clinical signs.  The probability of reporting
    vs. the number of days since a public announcement of an outbreak is fixed
    at 1.  On the day after the first detection, all direct contacts stop.

    When a unit is detected, trace out (forward) will be initiated.  The
    probability of success for a trace investigation is 1, and there is no
    delay for finding recipient units.  Units found by trace are quarantined
    and visually examined.

    There is no vaccination or destruction.
    
    What should happen:
     - On day 1 units 0 and 2 will be Latent.
     - On day 2 units 0 and 2 will be Infectious Clinical.  0 will ship to 1
       and 2 will ship to 0.  No detections will happen.  Counts of events: 2
       exposures, 0 detections, 0 exposures potentially traced, 0 exposures
       actually traced, and 0 exams.
     - On day 2 unit 0 will again ship to 1 and 2 will ship to 0.  Unit 2 will
       be detected.  The trace out will discover today’s and yesterday’s
       shipments to unit 0.  An exam will detect disease at unit 0 and the
       trace out will continue to discover today’s and yesterday’s shipments to
       unit 1.  An exam will not detect disease at unit 1.  Counts of
       events: 2 exposures, 2 detections, 4 exposures potentially traced, 4
       exposures actually traced, and 2 exams. The scenario is
       deliberately stopped at day 3.

    Test that when a unit can be detected by self-reporting and undergo an exam

  <parameter-description>
    For all production types, the latent period lasts 1 day, the infectious
    clinical period lasts 3 days, and immunity lasts 3 days.

    Pig units ship to sheep units once per day.  Sheep units ship to cattle
    units once per day.  Latent units cannot be the source of an exposure.
    The probability of infection given exposure is always too low to infect.

    For all production types, the probability of detection by self-reporting is
    too low on the first day the unit is showing clinical signs, but high
    enough to cause detection on the second day.  The probability of reporting
    vs. the number of days since a public announcement of an outbreak is fixed
    at 1.  On the day after the first detection, all direct contacts stop.

    When a unit is detected, trace out (forward) will be initiated.  The
    probability of success for a trace investigation is 1, and there is no
    delay for finding recipient units.  Units found by trace are quarantined
    and visually examined.

    There is no vaccination or destruction.
    
    What should happen:
     - On day 1 units 0 and 2 will be Latent.
     - On day 2 units 0 and 2 will be Infectious Clinical.  0 will ship to 1
       and 2 will ship to 0.  No detections will happen.  Counts of events: 2
       exposures, 0 detections, 0 exposures potentially traced, 0 exposures
       actually traced, and 0 exams.
     - On day 2 unit 0 will again ship to 1 and 2 will ship to 0.  Units 0 and
       2 will be detected by self-reporting.  The trace out from unit 2 will
       discover today’s and yesterday’s shipments to unit 0.  An exam will
       detect disease at unit 0 and the trace out will continue to discover
       today’s and yesterday’s shipments to unit 1.  An exam will not
       detect disease at unit 1.  Counts of events: 2 exposures, 2 detections,
       4 exposures potentially traced, 4 exposures actually traced, and 2
       exams.\n\n
       Note that this scenario could be envisioned as playing out two ways.
       One possibility is that the detection of unit 0 by self-reporting happens
       “first”, and so there is no need for an exam when unit 0 is found by
       tracing from unit 2.  The other possibility is that unit 0 is found by
       tracing “first”, and so it does need an exam.  The model does not try to
       resolve this: rather, detection by self-reporting and detection by exams
       are treated as happening independently/concurrently, and so the exam
       always happens.\n\n
       The scenario is deliberately stopped at day 3.

       test result (positive) will be available for unit 0.  Count of

       going to self-reporting or testing.\n\n

    The parameters are identical to "test result and self-reporting on same
    day" above.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 units 0 and 2 will be Latent.
     - On day 2 units 0 and 2 will be Infectious Clinical.  0 will ship to 1
       and 2 will ship to 0.  Unit 2 will be detected.  This is the first
       detection overall, the first detection in pigs, and the first detection
       by clinical signs.\n\n
       The trace out from unit 2 will discover today’s shipment to unit 0, and
       unit 0 will be examined.  Clinical signs will not be detected at unit 0
       (the probability is too low) so a test will be ordered.
     - On day 3 unit 0 will be detected by clinical signs.  This is the first
       detection in sheep.  Also on day 3, the test result (positive) will be
       available for unit 0.  There is a 50/50 chance of credit for the
       detection going to self-reporting or testing.  If credit goes to
       testing, this will be the first detection by testing.\n\n

    clinical signs.  The probability of reporting vs. the number of days
    since a public announcement of an outbreak is fixed at 1.  On the day
    after the first detection, all direct contacts stop.

    When a unit is detected, trace out (forward) will be initiated.  The
    probability of success for a trace investigation is 1, and there is no
    delay for finding recipient units.  Units found by trace are quarantined
    and visually examined.  If no clinical signs are detected by the visual
    exam, a test will be ordered.  The test sensitivity is 0 and the
    specificity is 1. Test results are available immediately.

    There is no vaccination or destruction.
    
    What should happen:
     - On day 1 units 0 and 2 will be Latent.
     - On day 2 units 0 and 2 will be Infectious Subclinical.  0 will ship to 1
       and 2 will ship to 0.
     - On day 3 units 0 and 2 will be Infectious Clinical.  Unit 2 will be
       detected, the trace out will discover yesterday’s shipment to unit 0,
       and unit 0 will be examined. Clinical signs will not be detected at unit
       0 (the probability is too low) so a test will be ordered.  The test will
       fail to discover the disease. Count of detections: 1.
     - On day 4 the probability of detection by clinical signs at unit 0 will
       be high enough that detection can occur. Unit 0 will be detected. Count
       of detections: 1.\n\n
       The scenario is deliberately stopped at day 4.

    For cattle, the latent period lasts 1 day, the infectious subclinical
    period lasts 1 day, the infectious clinical period lasts 3 days, and
    immunity lasts 3 days.  For pigs, the latent period lasts 1 day, the
    infectious clinical period lasts 3 days, and immunity lasts 3 days.

    Cattle units ship to pig units once per day.

    Pig units will be detected on the first day they show clinical signs.
    The probability of 

    When a unit is detected, that unit will be slated for destruction, and
    trace out (forward) and in (back) will be initiated.  The probability of
    success for a trace investigation is 1, and there is no delay for
    conducting the trace.  Units found by trace are quarantined and visually
    examined.
    
    What should happen:
     - On day 1 both units will be Latent.  The cattle unit will ship to the
       pig unit.
     - On day 2 the pig unit will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected
       and trace in and out will be initiated.  Trace in will find the cattle
       unit 0, and the cattle unit will be examined.  However, the cattle unit
       is still Infectious Subclinical, so no signs of disease will be detected.
     - On day 3 the pig unit will be destroyed.  The cattle unit will be
       Infectious Clinical, and it will be detected by clinical signs.
     - On day 4 the cattle unit will be destroyed.

    The parameters are adapted from the test “prevalence increasing” in the
    “Airborne spread” category of tests.

    As the disease prevalence increases in the initially infected unit (unit
    0), unit 1 gets an adequate exposure on day 4, unit 2 on day 5, and unit 3
    on day 6.

    Detection is set so that unit 0 will be detected on day 4, its first day
    showing clinical signs.
    
    There is no vaccination or destruction in response to a detection.
 
    What should happen:
     - Day 4 will be the day of first detection.
     - Up until day 4, the outputs “firstDetUInfAll” and “firstDetAInfAll”
       should have no numeric value.
     - On day 4, firstDetUInfAll should be 1 and firstDetAInfAll should be 25.
       (By the end of the day of first detection, 1 infection has occurred and
       the infected unit contains 25 animals.)
     - The test is deliberately stopped at 7 days.
