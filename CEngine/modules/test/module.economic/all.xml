  <parameter-description>
    The latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness lasts 3 days, clinical signs
    accompany infectiousness immediately, and natural immunity lasts 3 days.

    There is no spread.
    
    The probability of detecting a diseased unit vs. the number of days the
    animals have been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1. The probability of
    detecting a diseased unit vs. the number of days since a public
    announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    A vaccination program begins at the first detection.  The authorities will
    vaccinate units within 10 km of a detected unit.  The authorities have
    resources to vaccinate one unit each day.  The vaccine produces immunity
    immediately, and the immunity lasts 5 days.

    Vaccination site setup costs $23 per unit.  Vaccination costs $29 per
    animal for the first 1000 animals, and $29+$31 per animal after that.

    There is no destruction.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 unit 0 will be latent.
     - On day 2 unit 0 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected, and
       the remaining 4 units will be marked for vaccination because they are
       within 10 km of a detected unit.
     - On days 3-6 one unit is vaccinated each day.  The cost each day will be
       $23+$29*25 = $748.  In total 100 animals will be vaccinated, so the
       higher cost (for vaccinating >1000 animals) will never be incurred.

    Check cost accounting for vaccinating units of animals over
    several days.  Different production types have different costs
    associated with them.

  <parameter-description>
    For production type A, the latent period lasts 1 day, the infectious
    clinical period lasts 1 day, and immunity lasts 3 days.  The same is true
    for production type C.  Production types D-G each have one additional day
    on the latent period: 2 days for D, 3 days for E, etc.

    Airborne spread can occur from units of type A to units of types C-G.
    The probability of airborne spread at 1 km is 0.8723 and it drops off
    exponentially.  This parameter gives a 0.505 probability of infection at 5
    km (0.8723&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.505).

    The probability of detection vs. the number of days a unit has been showing
    clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The probability of detection vs. the number
    of days since a public announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    When a diseased unit is detected, all units of types C-G within 5 km will
    be marked for vaccination.  Vaccination capacity does not come on-line
    until after all units are detected in this scenario.

    There is no destruction.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 the infected units (0 and 1) will be Latent.
     - On day 2 units 0 and 1 will be Infectious Clinical.  They will be
       detected and both units will trigger vaccination rings.  Units 4-8 will
       be marked for vaccination.
     - On day 3, 1 unit (size 25) of type C is vaccinated.
       Cost=(1*$11)+(25*$12)
     - On day 4, 1 unit (size 25) of type D is vaccinated.
       Cost=(1*$21)+(25*$22)
     - On day 5, 1 unit (size 25) of type E is vaccinated.
       Cost=(1*$31)+(25*$32)
     - On day 6, 1 unit (size 25) of type F is vaccinated.
       Cost=(1*$41)+(25*$42)
     - On day 7, 1 unit (size 25) of type G is vaccinated.  Costs are the same as
       for type D to verify that the production type mask is read/processed
       correctly.
       Cost=(1*$21)+(25*$22)
     - On day 8, all queued units are already vaccinated, so there is nothing
       left to do.

    A destruction program begins at the first detection.  The authorities will
    destroy units within 10 km of a detected unit.  The authorities have
    resources to destroy one unit each day.  The vaccine produces immunity
    immediately, and the immunity lasts 5 days.

    The costs for destruction are: appraisal $37 per unit, euthanasia $41 per
    animal, disposal $47 per animal, indemnification $43 per animal, cleaning
    and disinfection $53 per unit.

    There is no vaccination.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 unit 0 will be latent.
     - On day 2 unit 0 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected and
       destruction.  The remaining units will be marked for destruction
       because they are within 10 km of a detected unit.
     - On days 3-7 a unit is destroyed each day.  There are 25 animals in each
       unit, so the cost each day will be $37+($41+$47+$43)*25+$53 = $3365.

    For all production types, the latent period lasts 1 day, the infectious
    clinical period lasts 1 day, and immunity lasts 3 days.

    The probability of detection vs. the number of days a unit has been showing
    clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The probability of detection vs. the number
    of days since a public announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    When a diseased unit is detected, all units of types C-G within 5 km will
    be marked for both vaccination and destruction.  (This might not be a
    sensible strategy, but it is a useful setup for this test.)  The authorities
    can destroy 1 unit per day.  Vaccination capacity does not come on-line
    until after all units are destroyed in this scenario.

    There is no spread.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 the infected units (0 and 1) will be Latent.
     - On day 2 units 0 and 1 will be Infectious Clinical.  They will be
       detected and both units will trigger vaccination rings.  Units 4-8 will

       Cost=($44+$48)+[25*($45+$46+$47)]
     - On day 7, 1 unit (size 25) of type G is destroyed.  Costs are the same as
       for type D to verify that the production type mask is read/processed
       correctly.

  <parameter-description>
    The latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness lasts 3 days, clinical signs
    accompany infectiousness immediately, and natural immunity lasts 3 days.

    There is no spread.
    
    The probability of detecting a diseased unit vs. the number of days the
    animals have been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1. The probability of
    detecting a diseased unit vs. the number of days since a public
    announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    A destruction program begins at the first detection.  The authorities will
    destroy units within 10 km of a detected unit.  The authorities have
    resources to destroy one unit each day.  The vaccine produces immunity
    immediately, and the immunity lasts 5 days.

    There are two zones, "High risk" and "Background".  When a diseased unit is
    detected, a "High risk" zone 10 km in radius is established around it.
    Surveillance costs $59 per animal per day inside the High risk zone.

    There is no vaccination.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 unit 0 will be latent.
     - On day 2 unit 0 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected and
       destruction.  The remaining units will also be marked for destruction
       because they are within 10 km of a detected unit.
     - On day 3, because of the detection, there will be a 10 km radius "High
       risk" zone in effect around unit 1.  All 5 units will be inside the
       zone.  The 5 units, with 25 animals each, cost $59*25*5=$7375 for
       surveillance.  One unit will be destroyed on this day.
     - On day 4 the 4 remaining units cost $59*25*4=$5900 for surveillance.
       One unit will be destroyed on this day.
     - On day 5 the 3 remaining units cost $59*25*3=$4425 for surveillance.
       One unit will be destroyed on this day.
     - On day 6 the 2 remaining units cost $59*25*2=$2950 for surveillance.
       One unit will be destroyed on this day.
     - On day 7 the 1 remaining unit costs $59*25=$1475 for surveillance.
       One unit will be destroyed on this day.  The total cost of surveillance
       has been $22125.

    Test that the surveillance costs are calculated correctly.  In this
    scenario, there are 16 units.  A small zone is established that covers
    5 units, and another zone around that covers 4 units.

  <parameter-description>
    The latent period lasts 1 day, the infectious clinical period lasts 3 days,
    and immunity lasts 3 days.

    The probability of detection vs. the number of days a unit has been showing
    clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The probability of detection vs. the number
    of days since a public announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    There are three zones, "High risk" ($59/animal-day), "Low risk" ($7/animal-day)
    and "Background" (unspecified and therefore $0/animal-day).  When a
    diseased unit is is detected, a "High risk" zone 1.25 km in radius and a
    "Low risk" zone 1.75 km in radius are established around it.

    There is no spread, destruction or vaccination.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 the infected unit (unit 6) will be Latent.
       Because there are no zones yet, the count of units in the "Background"
       zone should be 16, and with 25 animals in each unit, the number of
       animal-days in the "Background" zone should be 16*25=400.
       Cost=400*$0+0*$7+0*$59
     - On day 2 unit 6 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected.
       There will still be just the "Background" zone, so the number of
       animal-days should increase to 800.
       Cost=400*$0+0*$7+0*$59
     - On day 3 a 1.25 km "High risk" zone and a 1.75 km "Low risk" zone will
       be in effect around unit 6.  5 units will be in the "High risk" zone,
       another 4 will be in the "Low risk" zone, and 7 will be outside (see
       diagram below).
       The number of animal-days in the "Background" zone should be
       800+7*25=975, the number in the "Low risk" zone should be 4*25=100, and
       the number in the "High risk" zone should be 5*25=125.       
       Cost=175*$0+100*$7+125*$59
     - On day 4 the number of animal-days in the "Background" zone should
       increase by 7*25 to 1150.  The number in the "Low risk" zone should
       increase by 4*25 to 200.  The number in the "High risk" zone should
       increase by 5*25 to 250.
       Cost=175*$0+100*$7+125*$59
     - On day 5 the infection will be over and unit 6 will be Immune.  Zones
       are still in effect, so the number of animal-days in the "Background"
       zone should increase by 7*25 to 1325, the number in the "Low risk" zone
       should increase by 4*25 to 300, and the number in the "High risk" zone
       should increase by 5*25 to 375.
       Cost=175*$0+100*$7+125*$59
