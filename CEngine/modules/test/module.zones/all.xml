    Test that the reported number of zones is correct.  In this baseline
    scenario, we declare one zone (the default or "background" zone) and we
    detect a diseased unit, but the detection does not cause a zone focus to be

    For pigs, the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness lasts 2 days,
    clinical signs accompany infectiousness immediately, and immunity lasts 1
    day.  For cattle, the latent period lasts 2 days, and the remaining
    parameters are the same.

    The probability of detection vs. the number of days a unit has been showing
    clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The probability of detection vs. the number
    of days since a public announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    There are two zones, "High risk" and "Background".  When a diseased unit is
    is detected, a "High risk" zone 1.25 km in radius is established around it.

    The authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The
    authorities can destroy an unlimited/very large number of units each day.

    There is no spread or vaccination.

    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
     - On day 1 two pig units (0 and 3) and one cattle unit (1) will be Latent.
     - On day 2 the pig will be Infectious Clinical.  They will be detected and
       and slated for destruction.
     - On day 3 a 1.25 km "High risk" zone will be in effect around each of the
       pig units, and the units will be destroyed.  The zone rings will not
       overlap, so the count of separate areas making up the "High risk" zone
       should be 2.  The infected cattle unit (1) will be Infectious Clinical.
       It will be detected and slated for destruction.
     - On day 4 a 1.25 km "High risk" zone will be in effect around the
       infected cattle unit (1), and the unit will be destroyed.  The zone ring
       will overlap the previously established rings and cause them to merge
       into one large area, so the count of separate areas making up the "High
       risk" zone should be 1.

    Test that the reported number of zones is correct when zone foci merge.
    In this scenario, we declare a "High risk" and a "Background" zone.
    Detection of 2 diseased units causes 2 separate zone foci to be
    established, then on the next day, detection of another diseased unit
    between them causes the separate foci to merge.

    This scenario is identical to "3 foci merge" above, except that it tracks
    the values of output variables rather than the states of units.

  <description>
    This is part of a series of tests that check that zones can be established
    by trace outs.  In this scenario, the index unit ships to two other units.
    The shipments fail to infect the recipient units, but the recipients are
    still found by trace out and destroyed.  

    This scenario is similar to "trace, no infect" above, except that a zone
    focus is only established around traced cattle units, not traced pig units.

  <parameter-description>
    For all production types, the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness
    lasts 2 days, clinical signs accompany infectiousness immediately, and
    immunity lasts 1 day.

    The movement rate from sheep units to cattle units is fixed at 1 shipment
    per day.  The distance of shipments is fixed at 10 km.  The probability of
    infection given exposure is 0.  Latent units are allowed to infect others.
    Movements from sheep units to pig units are the same.

    The probability of detecting a diseased sheep unit vs. the number of days
    the unit has been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The probability of
    detection vs. the number of days since a public announcement of an outbreak
    is also fixed at 1.  Diseased cattle and pig units are not detected.

    When a diseased unit is detected, a trace-out is attempted.  The
    probability of success for tracing a movement to any unit is 1.0.
    Recipient units found by trace-out are destroyed.

    There are two zones, "High risk" and "Background".  When a cattle unit is
    found by trace-out, a "High risk" zone 2 km in radius is established around
    it.  Note that in this scenario, zone foci are not established around
    detections, only around cattle units found by trace-outs.

    The authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The
    authorities can destroy an unlimited/very large number of units each day.

    There is no vaccination.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 unit 0 (sheep) will be Latent.  Unit 0 will ship to the cattle
       unit 10 km north (unit 1) and the pig unit 20 km north (unit 2) but will
       fail to infect them.
     - On day 2 unit 0 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected and
       and slated for destruction.  Trace out will find units 1 and 2, which
       will also be slated for destruction.
     - On day 3 a 2 km "High risk" zone will be in effect around unit 1.  The
       count of separate areas making up the "High risk" zone should be 1.
       Units 0, 1, and 2 will be destroyed.
     - On day 4 the state of units 0, 1, and 2 will show as "Destroyed".

  <description>
    Test that different detection parameters can be set in each zone.  An
    initially infected pig unit infects 2 nearby cattle units.  The pig unit is
    detected, and later on, the cattle are detected too.

    In this scenario, a baseline with no zones, detection for the 2 cattle
    units is the same.

  <parameter-description>
    For cattle (units 0 and 1), the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness
    lasts 3 days, clinical signs accompany infectiousness immediately, and
    immunity lasts 3 days.  For pigs (unit 2), the latent period lasts 1 day,
    day, infectiousness without clinical signs lasts 1 day, infectiousness with
    clinical signs lasts 3 days, and immunity lasts 3 days.

    The probability of airborne spread from a pig unit to a cattle unit at 1 km
    is 0.8248, and the maximum distance of airborne spread is 50 km.  These
    parameters give a 0.505 probability of infection at 20 km.  No parameters
    are set for spread between pig units, between cattle units, or from cattle
    units to pig units.

    The probability of detection vs. the number of days a pig unit has been
    showing clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The probability of detection vs. the
    number of days since a public announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at
    1.

    The probability of detection is 0.4 when a cattle unit first shows clinical
    signs.  It increases linearly to 0.6 after one day.  The probability of
    detection vs. the number of days since a public announcement of an outbreak
    is fixed at 1.
    
    The authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The
    authorities can destroy an unlimited number of units each day.
    
    There is no vaccination.

    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
     - On day 1 unit 2 (pigs) will be Latent.
     - On day 2 unit 2 (pigs) will be Infectious Subclinical.  It will infect
       units 0 and 1 (cattle).
     - On day 3 units 0 and 1 will be Latent.  Unit 2 (pigs) will be Infectious
       Clinical; it will be detected and marked for destruction.
     - On day 4 unit 2 will be destroyed.  No zones will be in effect.  Units 0
       and 1 will be Infectious Clinical, but will not be detected because p is
       still too low (0.4).
     - On day 5 units 0 and 1 will be detected and marked for destruction.
     - On day 6 units 0 and 1 will be destroyed.

  <description>
    Test that different detection parameters can be set in each zone.  An
    initially infected pig unit infects 2 nearby cattle units.  The pig unit is
    detected, and later on, the cattle are detected too.

    In this scenario, a zone focus is established around the pig unit.  One
    cattle unit is inside the zone, and is detected a day sooner than the
    cattle unit outside the zone.

    parameters give a 0.505 probability of infection at 20 km.  No parameters
    are set for spread between pig units, between cattle units, or from cattle
    units to pig units.

    The probability of detection vs. the number of days a pig unit has been

    number of days since a public announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at
    1.

    The probability of detection is 0.4 when a cattle unit first shows clinical
    signs.  It increases linearly to 0.6 after one day.  The probability of
    detection vs. the number of days since a public announcement of an outbreak
    is fixed at 1.

    There are two zones, "High risk" and "Background".  When a diseased pig

       Clinical; it will be detected and marked for destruction.
     - On day 4 unit 2 will be destroyed.  A 15 km "High risk" zone will be in
       effect around unit 2.  Units 0 and 1 will be Infectious Clinical.  Unit
       0, which is outside the zone, will not be detected because p is still
       too low (0.4).  Unit 1, which is inside the zone, will be detected
       because of the multiplier (0.4 * 2 = 0.8) and marked for destruction.
     - On day 5 unit 1 will be destroyed.  Unit 0 will be detected and marked

       detected and slated for destruction, and a focus of the "High risk" zone
       0.5 km in radius will be established around each.  The foci will not
       overlap, therefore the cattle unit in the middle (4) will not be
       enclosed.
     - On day 4 the pig units will be destroyed.  The infected cattle unit (4)
       will be Infectious Clinical; it will infect the other cattle unit (5).
     - On day 5 the newly-infected cattle unit (5) will be Latent.

    For pigs (units 0-3), the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness without

    days, and immunity lasts 3 days.  For cattle (units 4 and 5), the latent
    period lasts 3 days, infectiousness lasts 3 days, clinical signs accompany
    infectiousness immediately, and immunity lasts 4 days.

    The movement rate from cattle units to cattle units is fixed at 1 shipment
    per day.  The distance of shipments is fixed at 1 km.  The movement rate
    multiplier is 0 until the public is aware of the outbreak, then it
    immediately goes to 1.  (This is the opposite of what one might expect from
    movement controls; its purpose here is to make sure any contact we see
    between cattle units happens after the establishment of zones, not before.)
    No parameters are set for movement from cattle units to pig units, from pig
    units to cattle units, or between pig units.

    There are two zones, "High risk" and "Disease free".  When a diseased pig
    unit is detected, a "High risk" zone 0.75 km in radius is established
    around it.
    
    The probability of detection vs. the number of days a pig unit has been

       "High risk" zone.
     - On day 4 the pig units will be destroyed.  The infected cattle unit (4)
       will be Infectious Clinical, but it will not be able to ship to the

    For both cattle and pigs, the latent period lasts 3 days, infectiousness
    lasts 5 days, clinical signs accompany infectiousness immediately, and
    immunity lasts 4 days.

    The indirect contact rate from cattle units to pig units is fixed at 2 per
    day.  The distance of contacts is fixed at 10 km.  No parameters are set
    for contact for any other production type combinations.

    The probability of detection vs. the number of days a pig unit has been
    showing clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The probability of detection vs. the
    number of days since a public announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at
    1.  Diseased cattle units are not detected.
    
    There are two zones, "High risk" and "Disease free".  When a diseased pig
    unit is detected, a "High risk" zone 15 km in radius is established around
    it.

    There is no destruction or vaccination.

    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
     - On day 1 both units will be Latent.
     - Day 2 and day 3 will be the same as day 1.
     - On day 4 both units will be Infectious Clinical.  The pig unit will be
       detected.  There will be 2 exposures from unit 0 to unit 1.
     - On day 5, because of the detection, there will be a 15 km radius "High
       risk" zone in effect around unit 1.  Both units will be inside the zone.
       However, because no special movement controls have been set for cattle
       units inside the zone, there will again be 2 exposures from unit 0 to
       unit 1.
     - On days 6, 7, and 8 (the remainder of the Infectious Clinical period)
       there will be 2 exposures from unit 0 to unit 1 each day.
     - On day 9 both units will be Immune.

    There are two zones, "High risk" and "Disease free".  When a diseased pig
    unit is detected, a "High risk" zone 15 km in radius is established around

    half after a detection.

    There is no destruction or vaccination.

       Because special movement controls have been set for cattle units inside
       the zone, there will be only 1 exposure from unit 0 to unit 1.

    The latent period lasts 1 day, the infectious clinical period lasts 3 days,

    The probability of detection vs. the number of days a unit has been showing
    clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The probability of detection vs. the number
    of days since a public announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    When a diseased unit is detected, a "High risk" zone 1.75 km in radius is
    established around it.

    There is no spread, destruction or vaccination.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 the infected unit (unit 6) will be Latent.
       Because there are no zones yet, the count of units in the "Background"
       zone should be 16, and with 25 animals in each unit, the number of
       animal-days in the "Background" zone should be 16*25=400.
     - On day 2 unit 6 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected.
       There will still be just the "Background" zone, so the number of
       animal-days should increase to 800.
     - On day 3 a 1.75 km "High risk" zone will be in effect around unit 6.
       Nine units will be inside the zone and 7 outside (see diagram below).
       The number of animal-days in the "Background" zone should be
       800+7*25=975, and the number of animal-days in the "High risk" zone
       should be 9*25=225.
     - On day 4 the number of animal-days in the "Background" zone should
       increase by 7*25 to 1150.  The number of animal-days in the "High risk"
       zone should increase by 9*25 to 450.
     - On day 5 the infection will be over and unit 6 will be Immune.  Zones
       are still in effect, so the number of animal-days in the "Background"
       zone should increase by 7*25 to 1325, and the number of animal-days in
       the "High risk" zone should increase by 9*25 to 675.

    The latent period lasts 1 day, the infectious clinical period lasts 2 days,

    The probability of detection vs. the number of days a unit has been showing
    clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The probability of detection vs. the number
    of days since a public announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    When a diseased unit is detected, a "High risk" zone 1 km in radius is
    established around it.

    There is no spread, vaccination, or destruction.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 the infected unit (unit 0) will be Latent.
       Because there are no zones yet, the count of units in the "Background"
       zone should be 51.

  <description>
    This is one of a set of 5 scenarios to check that zone perimeter is
    calculated correctly.  In this scenario, two zone circles are created, and
    they overlap.

    NB: Since polygons are used to approximate zone circles, the perimeter
    calculation will not be exact.

  <parameter-description>
    Parameters: see "1 zone, 2 foci, merging, check reporting variables" above.

    The perimeter of the zone will be the sum of the perimeters of the two
    circles, minus the two short arcs in the overlap area:

    theta = arccos(5/5.5)
    
    perimeter = 2 * pi*5.5*2 * (360-2*theta)/360 = 59.66 km.

    Note that maxZonePerimeterDay should have no value until a zone is
    established, and finalZonePerimeter should have no value until the end of
    the simulation.

  <parameter-description>
    For units of production type “A” and “C”, the latent period lasts 1 day,
    the infectious clinical period lasts 10 days, and the immune period lasts 5
    days.  Production type “B” is similar, but adds a 1 day infectious
    subclinical period.

    The rate of shipments from units of type “C” to other units of type “C” os
    fixed at 1 per day.  The distance is fixed at 2 km.  The probability of
    infection transfer is 0.

    Units of production type “A” and “B” will be detected and reported on the
    first day they show clinical signs.  When a detection occurs, a “High risk”
    zone with radius 0.75 km will be established around the unit.

    There is no vaccination or destruction.

    What should happen:
     - On each day, there will be 1 exposure, a shipment from unit 7 will to
       unit 8.
     - On day 1, all of the units except unit 8 will be latent.
     - On day 2, units 0-5 will be infectious clinical.  They will be detected.
     - On day 3 the zones around units 0-5 will be established.  The high risk
       zone will be in 2 separate parts.\n\n
       Also on day 3, unit 6 will be infectious clinical.  It will be detected.
     - On day 4 the zone around unit 6 will be established.  It will join the
       two previously established parts of the high risk zone, creating one
       large zone with 2 holes in it, as shown in the diagram below.\n\n
       If the 2 holes were left as holes, one might expect the exposures from
       unit 7 to unit 8 to stop, since those units would now be cut off from
       each other.  But the one exposure each day should continue.
       The scenario is deliberately ended at 6 days.
