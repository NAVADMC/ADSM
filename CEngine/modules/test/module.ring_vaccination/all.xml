  <description>
    Test a scenario where the disease is spreading.  Use airborne spread with
    infection certain at 1 km but prevent spread farther than 1 km.

    In this first test there is no vaccination, to confirm that spread acts as
    we expect.  The disease should spread every second day because of the 1 day
    latent period.  It should spread outward in a ring; the immunity period
    should prevent spread back inward.  So:
    
    units 2, 5, 7, and 10 should become infected on day 2

    units 1, 3, 4, 9, 11, and 14 should become infected on day 4
    
    units 0, 8, 13, and 16 should become infected on day 6

    unit 12 should become infected on day 8

  <description>
    Run again, but with 1 km ring vaccination and a 1-day delay for vaccine to
    take effect.  This should not prevent spread.  When the index unit (6) is
    diagnosed, its immediate neighbours (units 2, 5, 7, and 10) will be
    vaccinated.  But they will be infected on that same day, so by the next day
    they will already be latent.

    For sheep (unit 0), the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness lasts 5
    days, clinical signs accompany infectiousness immediately, and immunity
    lasts 3 days.  No parameters are set for the disease in cattle or pigs.

    There is no spread.
    
    The probability of detecting diseased sheep vs. the number of days they
    have been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1. The probability of
    detecting diseased sheep vs. the number of days since a public announcement
    of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.  No parameters are set for detecting
    diseased cattle or pigs.

    The authorities will vaccinate cattle and pig units within 20 km of a
    diseased sheep unit.  The vaccine produces immunity immediately, and the
    immunity lasts 3 days.  The authorities can vaccinate an unlimited/very
    large number of units each day.

    There is no destruction.

    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt; On day 2 unit 0 (sheep) will be detected and units 1 and 2
        will be slated for vaccination.
      &lt;li&gt; On day 3 units 1 and 2 will be vaccinated.
      &lt;li&gt; Starting on day 4 and ending on day 6, units 1 and 2 will be

    Test a scenario with two production types with different vaccine
    parameters.  In this scenario, a sheep unit is initially infected, and when
    it is detected, the nearby cattle and pig units should be vaccinated.

    For sheep (unit 0), the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness lasts 5
    days, clinical signs accompany infectiousness immediately, and immunity
    lasts 3 days.  No parameters are set for the disease in cattle or pigs.

    There is no spread.
    
    The probability of detecting diseased sheep vs. the number of days they
    have been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1. The probability of
    detecting diseased sheep vs. the number of days since a public announcement
    of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.  No parameters are set for detecting
    diseased cattle or pigs.

    The authorities will vaccinate cattle and pig units within 20 km of a
    diseased sheep unit.  For cattle (unit 1), the vaccine produces immunity
    immediately, and the immunity lasts 3 days.  For pigs (unit 2), the vaccine
    requires 1 day to produce immunity, and the immunity lasts 1 day.  The
    authorities can vaccinate an unlimited/very large number of units each day.

    There is no destruction.

    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt; On day 2 unit 0 (sheep) will be detected and units 1 and 2
        will be slated for vaccination.
      &lt;li&gt; On day 3 units 1 and 2 will be vaccinated.
      &lt;li&gt; Starting on day 4 and ending on day 6, unit 1 will be immune.
      &lt;li&gt; For day 5 only, unit 2 will be immune.

    For pigs (unit 2), the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness lasts 6
    days, clinical signs accompany infectiousness immediately, and natural
    immunity lasts 3 days.  For sheep (unit 0), the latent period is 3 days
    longer.

    There is no spread.
    
    The probability of detecting diseased pigs and sheep vs. the number of days
    they have been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1. The probability of
    detecting diseased pigs and sheep vs. the number of days since a public
    announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.  No parameters are set for
    detecting diseased cattle.

    The authorities require 6 days to start up a destruction program, after
    which they can destroy 2 units per day.  The authorities will vaccinate
    cattle units within 10 km of a detection.  For cattle, the vaccine produces
    immunity immediately, and the immunity lasts 3 days.  The authorities will
    not re-vaccinate a unit for 31 days after a vaccination.

    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt; On day 1 units 0 (sheep) and 2 (pigs) will be latent.
      &lt;li&gt; On day 2 unit 2 (pigs) will be Infectious Clinical.  It will
        be detected and marked for destruction.  Unit 1 (cattle) will be
	marked for vaccination because it is within 10 km of unit 2.
      &lt;li&gt; On day 3 unit 1 (cattle) will be vaccinated.
      &lt;li&gt; On day 4 unit 1 (cattle) will be Vaccine Immune.
      &lt;li&gt; On day 5 unit 0 (sheep) will be Infectious Clinical.  It will
        be detected and marked for destruction.  Unit 1 (cattle) will not be
	vaccinated because too few days have passed since the last time.
      &lt;li&gt; On day 6 nothing new will happen.
      &lt;li&gt; On day 7 (3 days after becoming Vaccine Immune) unit 1 will
        return to Susceptible.
      &lt;li&gt; On day 8 (5 days after the first detection) units 0 and 2 will

  <parameter-description>
    For cattle, the latent period lasts 1 day, the infectious clinical period
    lasts 2 days, and immunity lasts 3 days.  Pigs are similar but the latent
    period is 5 days.

    For both production types, the probability of detection vs. the number of
    days a unit has been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The probability
    of detection vs. the number of days since a public announcement of an
    outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    When a diseased unit is detected, that unit is destroyed, and all units
    within 2.5 km will be vaccinated.  The vaccine produces immunity
    immediately, and the immunity lasts 3 days in cattle, 4 in pigs.  The
    minimum time between vaccinations is 4 days for cattle, 5 for pigs.  The
    authorities can vaccinate or destroy an unlimited/very large number of
    units each day.

    There is no spread.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 units 0 and 1 will be latent.
     - On day 2 unit 0 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected and
       marked for destruction, and all the other units will be marked for
       vaccination (including unit 1, because no-one knows it is infected yet).
     - On day 3 unit 0 will be destroyed and units 1-5 will be vaccinated.
       Their states will show the change on the next day.
     - On day 6 unit 1 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected and
       marked for destruction, and all the remaining non-destroyed units will
       be marked for vaccination.  (We don't know how long it will be before
       vaccination can be done, so we make the request for all units in the
       ring, ignoring the minimum time between vaccinations.)
     - On day 7 units 2 and 4 will be re-vaccinated because it has been 4 days
       since their last vaccination.  Units 3 and 5 will not, because there is
       a minimum 5 day wait for their production type.

    For all production types, the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness
    lasts 3 days, clinical signs accompany infectiousness immediately, and
    natural immunity lasts 3 days.

    There is no spread.
    
    The probability of detecting diseased units vs. the number of days they
    have been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1. The probability of
    detecting diseased units vs. the number of days since a public announcement
    of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    The authorities will destroy units that are detected as diseased.  The
    authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The authorities
    can destroy an unlimited/very large number of units each day.  The
    authorities will vaccinate cattle and pigs within 1.5 km of a detected
    cattle unit.  The vaccine produces immunity immediately, and the immunity
    lasts 5 days.  The authorities will not re-vaccinate a unit for 31 days
    after a vaccination.

    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt; On day 1 units 0 (cattle) and 1 (pigs) will be latent.

    type that triggered the ring.  In this scenario, detection of a diseased
    pig unit triggers a large vaccination ring.

  <parameter-description>
    For all production types, the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness
    lasts 3 days, clinical signs accompany infectiousness immediately, and
    natural immunity lasts 3 days.

    There is no spread.
    
    The probability of detecting diseased pig units vs. the number of days they
    have been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1. The probability of
    detecting diseased pig units vs. the number of days since a public
    announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.  The probability of
    detecting diseased cattle units is 0.

    The authorities will destroy units that are detected as diseased.  The
    authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The authorities
    can destroy an unlimited/very large number of units each day.  The
    authorities will vaccinate cattle and pigs within 1.5 km of a detected
    cattle unit, or within 2.5 km of a detected pig unit.  The authorities can
    vaccinate 3 units per day.  Cattle have priority over pigs.

    The vaccine produces immunity immediately, and the immunity lasts 5 days.
    The authorities will not re-vaccinate a unit for 31 days after a
    vaccination.

    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt; On day 1 units 0 (cattle) and 1 (pigs) will be latent.
      &lt;li&gt; On day 2 units 0 and 1 will be Infectious Clinical.  Unit 1
        (pigs) will be detected and marked for destruction.  Units 0, 2, 3, 4
        and 5 will be marked for vaccination because they are within 2.5 km of a
        detected pig unit.
      &lt;li&gt; On day 3 unit 1 will be destroyed.  Units 0, 2 and 4 will be
        vaccinated because they are cattle.
      &lt;li&gt; On day 4 units 2 and 4 will be immune.  Units 3 and 5 will be
        vaccinated.
      &lt;li&gt; On day 5 units 3 and 5 will be immune.

    Test that units that are marked for vaccination are not quarantined while
    waiting for the vaccination to happen.  This is different from destruction,
    in which units are quarantined while waiting for the destruction to happen.
    
    In this test and the following two, there are three units of different
    production types:

    0-&gt;1  2

    Units 0 and 2 are infected; the middle unit 1 is not.  The effects on unit
    1 can be observed when a) unit 1 is marked for vaccination, b) unit 0
    attempts to ship to unit 1, and c) both.

    In this scenario, unit 1 is not marked for vaccination, and unit 0 attempts
    to ship to unit 1.

    For all production types, the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness
    lasts 3 days, clinical signs accompany infectiousness immediately, and
    natural immunity lasts 5 days.

    The movement rate from sheep units to cattle units is fixed at 1 shipment
    each day.  The distance of shipments is fixed at 10 km.  The movement rate
    multiplier is 0 until the public is aware of the outbreak, then it
    immediately goes to 1.  (This is the opposite of what one might expect from
    movement controls; its purpose here is to make sure any contact we see
    between cattle units happens after the creation of vaccination rings, not
    before.)  There are no shipments between any other pairs of production
    types.

    Latent units can be the source of an exposure.
    
    The probability of infection given exposure is 1.
    
    The probability of detecting diseased pig units vs. the number of days they
    have been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1. The probability of
    detecting diseased pig units vs. the number of days since a public
    announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.  Other production types are
    not detected.

    The authorities will destroy units that are detected as diseased.  The
    authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The authorities
    can destroy 1 unit per day.

    A vaccination program begins at the first detection.  The authorities will
    vaccinate units within 5 km of a detected pig unit.  On the first day that
    vaccinations could occur, the vaccination capacity will be zero.  The next
    day and forward, the vaccination capacity is 1 unit per day.  The vaccine
    produces immunity immediately, and the immunity lasts 5 days.

    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
     - On day 1 units 0 (sheep) and 2 (pigs) will be latent.  There will be no
       shipments because the movement rate multiplier is 0.
     - On day 2 units 0 and 2 will be Infectious Clinical.  Unit 2 (pigs) will
       be detected and marked for destruction.  The 5 km radius vaccination
       ring drawn around unit 2 will not be large enough to cover unit 1.
     - On day 3 (1 day after the first detection) the movement rate multiplier
       will be 1.  Unit 0 (sheep) will ship to and infect unit 1 (cattle).
       Unit 2 will be destroyed.
     - On day 4 unit 1 will be Latent.

    The latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness lasts 3 days, clinical signs
    accompany infectiousness immediately, and natural immunity lasts 3 days.

    There is no spread.
    
    The probability of detecting a diseased unit vs. the number of days the
    animals have been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1. The probability of
    detecting a diseased unit vs. the number of days since a public
    announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    A vaccination program begins at the first detection.  The authorities will
    vaccinate units within 10 km of a detected unit.  On the first 4 days that
    vaccinations could occur, the vaccination capacity will be zero.  The next
    day and forward, the vaccination capacity is 1 unit per day.  The vaccine
    produces immunity immediately, and the immunity lasts 5 days.

    There is no destruction.

    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
     - On day 1 unit 0 will be latent.
     - On day 2 unit 0 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected, and
       unit 1 will be marked for vaccination because it is within 10 km of a
       detected unit.
     - Day 3 is the first day that vaccinations could happen, but there will be
       no vaccination capacity for 4 days.
     - On day 4 there will be no vaccination capacity for another 3 days.
     - On day 5 unit 0 will no longer be infectious.  However, the simulation
       will keep going because there are still vaccination tasks to be done.
       There will be no vaccination capacity for another 2 days.
     - On day 6 there will be no vaccination capacity for another 1 day.
     - On day 7 unit 1 will be vaccinated.
     - On day 8 unit 1's state will show as Immune.  Because there are no
       infectious units left and nothing left to do, the simulation can end.

    Test that the simulation's early-exit rules are followed with respect to
    units waiting for vaccination.
    
    In the tests "early exit" 1-3, there are two units.  Unit 0 is infected.
    On day 1 unit 0 is detected and unit 1 is marked for vaccination.
    Different effects can be observed when a) there are resources to vaccinate
    unit 1 immediately, b) there are no resources to vaccinate unit 1 at first,
    but resources eventually come on-line, or c) there are never resources to
    vaccinate unit 1.

    In this scenario, there are never resources to vaccinate unit 1.

  <description>
    Test that the simulation's early-exit rules are followed with respect to
    units waiting for vaccination.
    
    In the tests "early exit" 4-6, there are three units.  Unit 0 is infected.
    On day 1 unit 0 is detected and units 1 and 2 are marked for vaccination.
    Different effects can be observed when a) there are resources to vaccinate
    both units, b) there are resources to vaccinate one unit, then later there
    are resources to vaccinate the other, or c) there are resources to
    vaccinate one unit, but never resources to vaccinate the other.

    In this scenario, there are resources to vaccinate one unit, then later
    there are resources to vaccinate the other.

  <parameter-description>
    For all production types, the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness
    lasts 3 days, clinical signs accompany infectiousness immediately, and
    natural immunity lasts 3 days.

    There is no spread.
    
    The probability of detecting a diseased unit vs. the number of days the
    animals have been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1. The probability of
    detecting a diseased unit vs. the number of days since a public
    announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    A vaccination program begins at the first detection.  The authorities will
    vaccinate units within 20 km of a detected unit.  On the first 4 days that
    vaccinations could occur, the vaccination capacity will be zero.  The next
    day, the vaccination capacity is 1 unit.  Another day of zero capacity
    follows, then on the next day and forward the vaccination capacity is 1
    unit per day.  Cattle have priority over pigs.  The vaccine produces
    immunity immediately, and the immunity lasts 5 days.

    There is no destruction.

    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
     - On day 1 unit 0 will be latent.
     - On day 2 unit 0 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected, and
       units 1 and 2 will be marked for vaccination because they are within 20
       km of a detected unit.
     - Day 3 is the first day that vaccinations could happen, but there will be
       no vaccination capacity for 4 days.
     - On day 4 there will be no vaccination capacity for another 3 days.
     - On day 5 unit 0 will no longer be infectious.  However, the simulation
       will keep going because there are still vaccination tasks to be done.
       There will be no vaccination capacity for another 2 days.
     - On day 6 there will be no vaccination capacity for another 1 day.
     - On day 7 there is capacity to vaccinate 1 unit.  Unit 1 will be chosen
       because cattle have priority over pigs.
     - On day 8 unit 1's state will show as Immune.  There is no capacity to
       vaccinate on day 8.
     - On day 9 there is capacity to vaccinate 1 unit.  Unit 2 will be
       vaccinated.
     - On day 10 unit 2's state will show as Immune.  Because there are no
       infectious units left and nothing left to do, the simulation can end.

     - On day 8 unit 1's state will show as Immune.  There is no capacity to

       2 waited 7 days).
     - On day 10 unit 2's state will show as Immune.  Because there are no
       infectious units left and nothing left to do, the simulation can end.

  <description>
    Test that the simulation's early-exit rules are followed with respect to
    units waiting for vaccination.
    
    In the tests "early exit" 4-6, there are three units.  Unit 0 is infected.
    On day 1 unit 0 is detected and units 1 and 2 are marked for vaccination.
    Different effects can be observed when a) there are resources to vaccinate
    both units, b) there are resources to vaccinate one unit, then later there
    are resources to vaccinate the other, or c) there are resources to
    vaccinate one unit, but never resources to vaccinate the other.

    In this scenario, there are resources to vaccinate one unit, but never
    resources to vaccinate the other.

    For all production types, the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness
    lasts 3 days, clinical signs accompany infectiousness immediately, and
    natural immunity lasts 3 days.

    There is no spread.
    
    The probability of detecting a diseased unit vs. the number of days the
    animals have been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1. The probability of
    detecting a diseased unit vs. the number of days since a public
    announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    A vaccination program begins at the first detection.  The authorities will
    vaccinate units within 20 km of a detected unit.  On the first 4 days that
    vaccinations could occur, the vaccination capacity will be zero.  The next
    day, the vaccination capacity is 1 unit.  All subsequent days have zero
    capacity.  Cattle have priority over pigs.  The vaccine produces immunity
    immediately, and the immunity lasts 5 days.

    There is no destruction.

    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
     - On day 1 unit 0 will be latent.
     - On day 2 unit 0 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected, and
       units 1 and 2 will be marked for vaccination because they are within 20
       km of a detected unit.
     - Day 3 is the first day that vaccinations could happen, but there will be
       no vaccination capacity for 4 days.
     - On day 4 there will be no vaccination capacity for another 3 days.
     - On day 5 unit 0 will no longer be infectious.  However, the simulation
       will keep going because there are still vaccination tasks to be done.
       There will be no vaccination capacity for another 2 days.
     - On day 6 there will be no vaccination capacity for another 1 day.
     - On day 7 there is capacity to vaccinate 1 unit.  Unit 1 will be chosen
       because cattle have priority over pigs.
     - On day 8 unit 1's state will show as Immune.  Because there are no
       infectious units left and nothing left to do, the simulation can end.

    Test that the vaccination waiting list is updated correctly when a unit is
    destroyed while awaiting vaccination.
    
    In the tests "destroyed while waiting" 1-3, there are two units.  Unit 0 is
    infected.  On day 1 unit 0 is detected and unit 1 is marked for both
    vaccination and destruction.  Different effects can be observed when a)
    vaccination happens before destruction, b) destruction happens before
    vaccination, or c) vaccination and destruction actions come up on the same
    day.

    In this scenario, vaccination happens before destruction.

    The latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness lasts 3 days, clinical signs
    accompany infectiousness immediately, and natural immunity lasts 3 days.

    There is no spread.
    
    The probability of detecting a diseased unit vs. the number of days the
    animals have been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1. The probability of
    detecting a diseased unit vs. the number of days since a public
    announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    At the first detection, vaccination and destruction programs begin.  The
    authorities will both vaccinate and destroy units within 10 km of a
    detected unit.  (This might not be a sensible strategy, but it is a useful
    setup for this test.)  On the first 4 days that vaccinations could occur,
    the vaccination capacity will be zero.  The next day and forward, the
    vaccination capacity is 1 unit per day.  The vaccine produces immunity
    immediately, and the immunity lasts 5 days.

    On the first 6 days that destructions could occur, the destruction capacity
    will be zero.  The next day and forward, the destruction capacity is 1 unit

    Test that the vaccination waiting list is updated correctly when a unit is
    destroyed while awaiting vaccination.
    
    In the tests "destroyed while waiting" 1-3, there are two units.  Unit 0 is
    infected.  On day 1 unit 0 is detected and unit 1 is marked for both
    vaccination and destruction.  Different effects can be observed when a)
    vaccination happens before destruction, b) destruction happens before
    vaccination, or c) vaccination and destruction actions come up on the same
    day.

    In this scenario, destruction happens before vaccination.

    The latent period lasts 1 day, the infectious clinical period lasts 2 days,
    and immunity lasts 3 days.

    The probability of detection vs. the number of days a unit has been showing
    clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The probability of detection vs. the number
    of days since a public announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    When a diseased unit is detected, all units within 1 km will be vaccinated.
    The authorities can vaccinate an unlimited/very large number of units each
    day.

    There is no spread or destruction.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 the infected unit (unit 0) will be Latent.
     - On day 2 unit 0 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected.  The
       46 units around unit 0 will be marked for vaccination.
     - On day 3 those units will be vaccinated.

    For cattle units, the latent period lasts 1 day, the infectious clinical

    the latent period lasts 3 days.

    For both production types, the probability of detection vs. the number of

    of detection vs. the number of days since a public announcement of an

    When a diseased cattle unit is detected, that unit is destroyed.  When a
    diseased pig unit is detected, all units within 2 km will be vaccinated.
    The vaccine produces immunity immediately, and the immunity lasts 5 days.
    The authorities can vaccinate or destroy an unlimited/very large number of
    units each day.

    There is no spread.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 the infected units (0 and 1) will be Latent.
     - On day 2 unit 0 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected and
       marked for destruction.
     - On day 3 unit 0 will be destroyed.
     - On day 4 unit 1 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected and

       which detection should come "first", but the day's final count for units
       awaiting vaccination should be 2.
     - On day 3 units 4 and 5 will be vaccinated.

    For both cattle and pigs, the latent period lasts 1 day, the infectious
    clinical period lasts 2 days, and immunity lasts 3 days.

    For both production types, the probability of detection vs. the number of
    days a unit has been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The probability
    of detection vs. the number of days since a public announcement of an
    outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    When a diseased unit is detected, all units within 2.5 km will be
    vaccinated, excluding detected ones.  The vaccine produces immunity
    immediately, and the immunity lasts 5 days. The authorities can vaccinate
    an unlimited/very large number of units each day.

    There is no spread or destruction.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 the infected units (0 and 1) will be Latent.
     - On day 2 units 0 and 1 will be Infectious Clinical.  They will be
       detected and both units will trigger vaccination rings.  We don't commit
       to which detection should come "first", but the day's final count for
       units awaiting vaccination should be 4.
     - On day 3 units 2, 3, 4 and 5 will be vaccinated.

    The probability of detection vs. the number of days a unit has been showing
    clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The probability of detection vs. the number
    of days since a public announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    When a diseased unit is detected, all units of types C-G within 5 km will
    be marked for both vaccination and destruction.  (This might not be a
    sensible strategy, but it is a useful setup for this test.)  The authorities
    can destroy 1 unit per day.  Vaccination capacity does not come on-line
    until after all units are destroyed in this scenario.

    There is no spread.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 the infected units (0 and 1) will be Latent.
     - On day 2 units 0 and 1 will be Infectious Clinical.  They will be
       detected and both units will trigger vaccination rings.  Units 4-8 will
       be marked for both vaccination and destruction.
     - On days 3-7, one of the waiting units will be destroyed each day.  The

    For production type A, the latent period lasts 1 day, the infectious
    clinical period lasts 1 day, and immunity lasts 3 days.  The same is true
    for production type C.  Production types D-G each have one additional day
    on the latent period: 2 days for D, 3 days for E, etc.

    Airborne spread can occur from units of type A to units of types C-G.
    The probability of airborne spread at 1 km is 0.8723 and it drops off
    exponentially.  This parameter gives a 0.505 probability of infection at 5
    km (0.8723&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.505).

    The probability of detection vs. the number of days a unit has been showing
    clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The probability of detection vs. the number
    of days since a public announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    When a diseased unit is detected, all units of types C-G within 5 km will
    be marked for vaccination.  Vaccination capacity does not come on-line
    until after all units are detected in this scenario.

    There is no destruction.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 the infected units (0 and 1) will be Latent.
     - On day 2 units 0 and 1 will be Infectious Clinical.  They will be
       detected and both units will trigger vaccination rings.  Units 4-8 will
       be marked for vaccination.  Airborne spread from units 0 and 1 will
       infect units 4-8.
     - On day 3 the newly-infected units (4-8) will be Latent.
     - On days 4-8, one of the waiting units will become Infectious Clinical
       and be detected each day.  The count of units awaiting vaccination
       should drop by 1 each day.

    The parameters are identical to "destroyed while waiting, check count of
    units waiting" above.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 the infected units (0 and 1) will be Latent.
     - On day 2 units 0 and 1 will be Infectious Clinical.  They will be
       detected and both units will trigger vaccination rings.  Units 4-8 will
       be marked for both vaccination and destruction.  Unit-days and
       animal-days in queue will be 0 on this day: units are in queue, but no
       unit has spent a day in queue yet.
     - On days 3-7, one of the waiting units will be destroyed each day.  On
       day 3, the number of unit-days in queue will be 5 (one day each for the
       1 unit that was destroyed today and the 4 that are still in queue).
       Each unit has 25 animals, so the number of animal-days in queue will
       always be the unit-days multiplied by 25.  Note that days spent in the
       vaccination queue accumulate even though the vaccinations are being
       canceled.
     - On day 4, the number of unit-days in queue will increase by 4, to 9
       (one additional day each for the 1 unit that was destroyed today and the
       3 that are still in queue).
     - On day 5, the number of unit-days in queue will increase by 3, to 12.
     - On day 6, the number of unit-days in queue will increase by 2, to 14.
     - On day 7, the number of unit-days in queue will increase by 1, to 15.
       No more units are in queue, so the total number of unit-days in queue
       will remain at 15 on subsequent days.

    The latent period lasts 1 day, the infectious clinical period lasts 1 day,
    and immunity lasts 3 days.

    The probability of detection vs. the number of days a unit has been showing
    clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The probability of detection vs. the number
    of days since a public announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    The authorities will vaccinate units within 10 km of a detected unit.  The
    vaccine produces immunity immediately and the immunity lasts 5 days. The
    authorities can vaccinate 1 unit each day, starting 2 days after the 1st
    detection.

    There is no spread or destruction.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 unit 2 will be Latent.  Unit 0 will already be vaccine immune.
     - On day 2 unit 2 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected and
       unit 1 will be marked for vaccination because it is within 10 km.
     - On day 4 unit 1 will be vaccinated, and the average wait time should be
       2 (1 unit committed to vaccinate on day 2, vaccinated on day 4).  The
       initially vaccine immune unit, which did not wait at all, should not
       lower that number.

  <short-name>in queue twice, both vaccinations happen</short-name>

  <description>
    This is one of a set of scenarios that test counting of queued vaccinations
    when a unit is in the queue twice.  In this scenario, a unit's two stints

    For sheep and cattle, the latent period lasts 1 day, the infectious
    clinical period lasts 1 day, and immunity lasts 3 days.  For cattle, the
    latent period lasts 4 days and the other durations are the same.  For pigs,
    the latent period lasts 3 days and the other durations are the same.

    There is airborne spread from sheep units to cattle units, with exponential
    dropoff and p of spread at 1 km = 0.934.  (This makes the p of spread at 10
    km = 0.505, so with fixed "random" numbers of 0.5, spread will occur at 10
    km.)

    The probability of detection vs. the number of days a unit has been showing
    clinical signs is fixed at 1 for sheep and pigs, and 0 for cattle.  The
    probability of detection vs. the number of days since a public announcement
    of an outbreak is fixed at 1.

    All units within 11 km of a detected unit will be vaccinated.  Vaccination
    resources allow for 1 unit to be vaccinated 4 days after the first
    detection, and another unit 6 days after the first detection.  The vaccine
    produces immunity immediately and the immunity lasts 2 days.

    There is no spread or destruction.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 the infected units (0 and 2) will be Latent.
     - On day 2 unit 0 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will infect unit 1.  It
       will be detected and will trigger a vaccination ring.  Unit 1 will be
       marked for vaccination. The output vacwUAll will show 1 vaccination to
       do.
     - On day 3 the output vacwUDaysInQueue will show 1 (1 unit has spent 1 day
       in queue).
     - On day 4 unit 2 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected and
       will trigger a vaccination ring.  Unit 1 will again be marked for
       vaccination.  The output vacwUAll will show 2 vaccinations to do (of the
       same unit, but 2 vaccinations nonetheless).  The output vacwUDaysInQueue
       will show 2 (1 unit has spent 2 days in queue).
     - On day 5 the output vacwUDaysInQueue will show 3 (1 unit has spent 3
       days in queue).  Note that we are in the overlap between the unit's 2
       stints in queue right now, but this output does not double-count units 
       in that situation.
     - On day 6 (4 days after the first detection), there will be resources to
       vaccinate 1 unit.  Unit 1 will be vaccinated.  The vaccination will have
       no effect because unit 1 is already Latent.
     - On day 7 unit 1 will be Infectious Clinical, but it will not be detected
       because the probability of detection for cattle units is 0.
     - On day 8 (6 days after the first detection), there will be resources to
       vaccinate 1 unit.  Unit 1 will be vaccinated again.

  <description>
    There  can be more than one means of detection.  In this test, the
    threshold for vaccination is 3 detected units.  Two units are detected, the
    first by clinical signs, the second by clinical signs &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt;
    a positive test result on the same day.  No vaccinations should be done,
    because only 2 units have been detected (the unit that is detected twice
    should not count twice toward the vaccination threshold).

    This test failed in version 3.2.5 and was fixed in 3.2.6.

  <parameter-description>
    For sheep (unit 0), the infectious subclinical period lasts 1 day, the
    infectious clinical period lasts 1 day, and immunity lasts 5 days.  For
    cattle (unit 1) and pigs (unit 2), the latent period lasts 1 day, the
    infectious clinical period lasts 1 day, and immunity lasts 5 days.

    Sheep units send 1 shipment per day to cattle units.  The distance of
    shipment is 10 km, and the probability of infection is 1.  There are no
    other kinds of contact.

    Diseased units will be detected (by self-reporting) on their first day
    showing clinical signs.

    Direct contacts out of a detected unit will be traced.  There is no
    delay to trace, and tracing success is 100%.  Units found by trace will be
    examined; if no signs of disease are detected, they will be tested.  A
    test requires 1 day and has 100% sensitivity and specificity.

    Vaccination begins when disease has been detected in 3 units.  Pig units
    within 15 km of a diseased cattle unit will be vaccinated.  Vaccination
    resources allow for 10 units to be vaccinated per day.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 unit 0 will be Infectious Subclinical.  It will ship to and
       infect unit 1.
     - On day 2 unit 1 will be Latent.  Unit 0 will be Infectious Clinical.
       Unit 0 will be detected.  Because it is a sheep unit, it will not
       trigger a vaccination ring.  However, it will trigger a trace, which
       will lead to unit 1.  Unit 1 will be examined, but no clinical signs of
       disease will be found (it is still Latent).  A test will be ordered.
     - On day 3 unit 1 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected by
       clinical signs.  Also on this day, a positive test result will come back
       for unit 1.  However, since only 1 units have been detected up to this
       point, no vaccination will be done.

  <description>
    This test shows a bug that was discovered in April 2014. The test will not
    fail if run once with the random number generator “fixed”, but it will fail
    if run many times without the random number generator fixed.

    For sheep, the latent period lasts 1 day, the infectious subclinical period
    lasts 1 day, the infectious clinical period lasts 1 day. For cattle, the
    latent period lasts 1 day and the infectious clinical period lasts 2 days.
    For pigs, the latent period lasts 1 day and the infectious clinical period
    lasts 3 days. Immunity lasts 10 days for all types.

    For sheep, the probability of detection vs. the number of days a unit has
    been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1. The probability of reporting vs.
    the number of days since a public announcement of an outbreak is also fixed
    at 1. For cattle and pigs, the probability of detection vs. the number of
    days a unit has been showing clinical signs is fixed at 0.4, and the
    probability of reporting vs. the number of days since a public announcement
    of an outbreak is fixed at 1.

    When a diseased unit is detected, a trace out of direct contacts is
    initiated. The probability of success is 100% but there is a 3-day delay
    for trace results. Units identified by trace are examined for clinical
    signs; probability of detection is 2x the normal probability for
    self-reporting. If the exam does not detect clinical signs, a lab test is
    done. Tests have 100% sensitivity and specificity, and test results are
    available immediately.

    When a diseased pig unit is detected, all units within 15 km will be
    vaccinated, excluding detected ones. The delay to immunity is 2 days, and
    the immunity lasts 5 days. The authorities can vaccinate 3 units per day.

    There is no spread or destruction.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 unit 0 (sheep) will be Latent.
     - On day 2 unit 0 will be Infectious Subclinical. It will expose and
       infect units 1 and 2 by direct contact.
     - On day 3 unit 0 will be Infectious Clinical. It will be detected and a
       trace of direct contacts will be initiated. Units 1 and 2 will be
       Latent.
     - On day 4 units 1 and 2 will be Infectious Clinical, but the probability
       of detection is too low for them to be detected.
     - On day 5 units 1 and 2 will be Infectious Clinical, but the probability
       of detection is too low for them to be detected.
     - On day 6 unit 1 (cattle) will be Naturally Immune and unit 2 (pigs) will
       still be Infectious Clinical. The probability of detection for unit 2 is
       still too low for it to be detected. The results of the trace initiated
       on day 3 will become available and cause both units 1 and 2 to be
       examined. Unit 2 will be detected, which will trigger a vaccination ring
       that includes unit 1. Unit 1 will not be detected by clinical signs (it
       is immune now) so it will be tested. The test will come back positive
       and that will cancel the request for vaccination of unit 1. It is at
       this point that the bug will show, because the vaccination list monitor
       may process the “vaccination canceled” event before it processes the
       “request for vaccination” event.
     - Nothing more of interest happens on day 7.
