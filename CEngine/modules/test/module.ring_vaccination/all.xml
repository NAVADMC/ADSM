  <description>
    Test a scenario where the disease is spreading.  Use airborne spread with
    infection certain at 1 km but prevent spread farther than 1 km.

    In this first test there is no vaccination, to confirm that spread acts as
    we expect.  The disease should spread every second day because of the 1 day
    latent period.  It should spread outward in a ring; the immunity period
    should prevent spread back inward.  So:
    
    units 2, 5, 7, and 10 should become infected on day 2

    units 1, 3, 4, 9, 11, and 14 should become infected on day 4
    
    units 0, 8, 13, and 16 should become infected on day 6

    unit 12 should become infected on day 8

  <description>
    Run again, but with 1 km ring vaccination and a 1-day delay for vaccine to
    take effect.  This should not prevent spread.  When the index unit (6) is
    diagnosed, its immediate neighbours (units 2, 5, 7, and 10) will be
    vaccinated.  But they will be infected on that same day, so by the next day
    they will already be latent.

    For sheep (unit 0), the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness lasts 5
    days, clinical signs accompany infectiousness immediately, and immunity
    lasts 3 days.  No parameters are set for the disease in cattle or pigs.

    There is no spread.
    
    The probability of detecting diseased sheep vs. the number of days they
    have been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1. The probability of
    detecting diseased sheep vs. the number of days since a public announcement
    of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.  No parameters are set for detecting
    diseased cattle or pigs.

    The authorities will vaccinate cattle and pig units within 20 km of a
    diseased sheep unit.  The vaccine produces immunity immediately, and the
    immunity lasts 3 days.  The authorities can vaccinate an unlimited/very
    large number of units each day.

    There is no destruction.

    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt; On day 2 unit 0 (sheep) will be detected and units 1 and 2
        will be slated for vaccination.
      &lt;li&gt; On day 3 units 1 and 2 will be vaccinated.
      &lt;li&gt; Starting on day 4 and ending on day 6, units 1 and 2 will be

    Test a scenario with two production types with different vaccine
    parameters.  In this scenario, a sheep unit is initially infected, and when
    it is detected, the nearby cattle and pig units should be vaccinated.

    For sheep (unit 0), the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness lasts 5
    days, clinical signs accompany infectiousness immediately, and immunity
    lasts 3 days.  No parameters are set for the disease in cattle or pigs.

    There is no spread.
    
    The probability of detecting diseased sheep vs. the number of days they
    have been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1. The probability of
    detecting diseased sheep vs. the number of days since a public announcement
    of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.  No parameters are set for detecting
    diseased cattle or pigs.

    The authorities will vaccinate cattle and pig units within 20 km of a
    diseased sheep unit.  For cattle (unit 1), the vaccine produces immunity
    immediately, and the immunity lasts 3 days.  For pigs (unit 2), the vaccine
    requires 1 day to produce immunity, and the immunity lasts 1 day.  The
    authorities can vaccinate an unlimited/very large number of units each day.

    There is no destruction.

    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt; On day 2 unit 0 (sheep) will be detected and units 1 and 2
        will be slated for vaccination.
      &lt;li&gt; On day 3 units 1 and 2 will be vaccinated.
      &lt;li&gt; Starting on day 4 and ending on day 6, unit 1 will be immune.
      &lt;li&gt; For day 5 only, unit 2 will be immune.

    For pigs (unit 2), the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness lasts 6
    days, clinical signs accompany infectiousness immediately, and natural
    immunity lasts 3 days.  For sheep (unit 0), the latent period is 3 days
    longer.

    There is no spread.
    
    The probability of detecting diseased pigs and sheep vs. the number of days
    they have been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1. The probability of
    detecting diseased pigs and sheep vs. the number of days since a public
    announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.  No parameters are set for
    detecting diseased cattle.

    The authorities require 6 days to start up a destruction program, after
    which they can destroy 2 units per day.  The authorities will vaccinate
    cattle units within 10 km of a detection.  For cattle, the vaccine produces
    immunity immediately, and the immunity lasts 3 days.  The authorities will
    not re-vaccinate a unit for 31 days after a vaccination.

    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt; On day 1 units 0 (sheep) and 2 (pigs) will be latent.
      &lt;li&gt; On day 2 unit 2 (pigs) will be Infectious Clinical.  It will
        be detected and marked for destruction.  Unit 1 (cattle) will be
	marked for vaccination because it is within 10 km of unit 2.
      &lt;li&gt; On day 3 unit 1 (cattle) will be vaccinated.
      &lt;li&gt; On day 4 unit 1 (cattle) will be Vaccine Immune.
      &lt;li&gt; On day 5 unit 0 (sheep) will be Infectious Clinical.  It will
        be detected and marked for destruction.  Unit 1 (cattle) will not be
	vaccinated because too few days have passed since the last time.
      &lt;li&gt; On day 6 nothing new will happen.
      &lt;li&gt; On day 7 (3 days after becoming Vaccine Immune) unit 1 will
        return to Susceptible.
      &lt;li&gt; On day 8 (5 days after the first detection) units 0 and 2 will

  <parameter-description>
    For cattle, the latent period lasts 1 day, the infectious clinical period
    lasts 2 days, and immunity lasts 3 days.  Pigs are similar but the latent
    period is 5 days.

    For both production types, the probability of detection vs. the number of
    days a unit has been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The probability
    of detection vs. the number of days since a public announcement of an
    outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    When a diseased unit is detected, that unit is destroyed, and all units
    within 2.5 km will be vaccinated.  The vaccine produces immunity
    immediately, and the immunity lasts 3 days in cattle, 4 in pigs.  The
    minimum time between vaccinations is 4 days for cattle, 5 for pigs.  The
    authorities can vaccinate or destroy an unlimited/very large number of
    units each day.

    There is no spread.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 units 0 and 1 will be latent.
     - On day 2 unit 0 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected and
       marked for destruction, and all the other units will be marked for
       vaccination (including unit 1, because no-one knows it is infected yet).
     - On day 3 unit 0 will be destroyed and units 1-5 will be vaccinated.
       Their states will show the change on the next day.
     - On day 6 unit 1 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected and
       marked for destruction, and all the remaining non-destroyed units will
       be marked for vaccination.  (We don't know how long it will be before
       vaccination can be done, so we make the request for all units in the
       ring, ignoring the minimum time between vaccinations.)
     - On day 7 units 2 and 4 will be re-vaccinated because it has been 4 days
       since their last vaccination.  Units 3 and 5 will not, because there is
       a minimum 5 day wait for their production type.

    For all production types, the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness
    lasts 3 days, clinical signs accompany infectiousness immediately, and
    natural immunity lasts 3 days.

    There is no spread.
    
    The probability of detecting diseased units vs. the number of days they
    have been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1. The probability of
    detecting diseased units vs. the number of days since a public announcement
    of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    The authorities will destroy units that are detected as diseased.  The
    authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The authorities
    can destroy an unlimited/very large number of units each day.  The
    authorities will vaccinate cattle and pigs within 1.5 km of a detected
    cattle unit.  The vaccine produces immunity immediately, and the immunity
    lasts 5 days.  The authorities will not re-vaccinate a unit for 31 days
    after a vaccination.

    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt; On day 1 units 0 (cattle) and 1 (pigs) will be latent.

    type that triggered the ring.  In this scenario, detection of a diseased
    pig unit triggers a large vaccination ring.

  <parameter-description>
    For all production types, the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness
    lasts 3 days, clinical signs accompany infectiousness immediately, and
    natural immunity lasts 3 days.

    There is no spread.
    
    The probability of detecting diseased pig units vs. the number of days they
    have been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1. The probability of
    detecting diseased pig units vs. the number of days since a public
    announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.  The probability of
    detecting diseased cattle units is 0.

    The authorities will destroy units that are detected as diseased.  The
    authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The authorities
    can destroy an unlimited/very large number of units each day.  The
    authorities will vaccinate cattle and pigs within 1.5 km of a detected
    cattle unit, or within 2.5 km of a detected pig unit.  The authorities can
    vaccinate 3 units per day.  Cattle have priority over pigs.

    The vaccine produces immunity immediately, and the immunity lasts 5 days.
    The authorities will not re-vaccinate a unit for 31 days after a
    vaccination.

    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt; On day 1 units 0 (cattle) and 1 (pigs) will be latent.
      &lt;li&gt; On day 2 units 0 and 1 will be Infectious Clinical.  Unit 1
        (pigs) will be detected and marked for destruction.  Units 0, 2, 3, 4
        and 5 will be marked for vaccination because they are within 2.5 km of a
        detected pig unit.
      &lt;li&gt; On day 3 unit 1 will be destroyed.  Units 0, 2 and 4 will be
        vaccinated because they are cattle.
      &lt;li&gt; On day 4 units 2 and 4 will be immune.  Units 3 and 5 will be
        vaccinated.
      &lt;li&gt; On day 5 units 3 and 5 will be immune.

    Test that units that are marked for vaccination are not quarantined while
    waiting for the vaccination to happen.  This is different from destruction,
    in which units are quarantined while waiting for the destruction to happen.
    
    In this test and the following two, there are three units of different
    production types:

    0-&gt;1  2

    Units 0 and 2 are infected; the middle unit 1 is not.  The effects on unit
    1 can be observed when a) unit 1 is marked for vaccination, b) unit 0
    attempts to ship to unit 1, and c) both.

    In this scenario, unit 1 is not marked for vaccination, and unit 0 attempts
    to ship to unit 1.

    For all production types, the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness
    lasts 3 days, clinical signs accompany infectiousness immediately, and
    natural immunity lasts 5 days.

    The movement rate from sheep units to cattle units is fixed at 1 shipment
    each day.  The distance of shipments is fixed at 10 km.  The movement rate
    multiplier is 0 until the public is aware of the outbreak, then it
    immediately goes to 1.  (This is the opposite of what one might expect from
    movement controls; its purpose here is to make sure any contact we see
    between cattle units happens after the creation of vaccination rings, not
    before.)  There are no shipments between any other pairs of production
    types.

    Latent units can be the source of an exposure.
    
    The probability of infection given exposure is 1.
    
    The probability of detecting diseased pig units vs. the number of days they
    have been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1. The probability of
    detecting diseased pig units vs. the number of days since a public
    announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.  Other production types are
    not detected.

    The authorities will destroy units that are detected as diseased.  The
    authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The authorities
    can destroy 1 unit per day.

    A vaccination program begins at the first detection.  The authorities will
    vaccinate units within 5 km of a detected pig unit.  On the first day that
    vaccinations could occur, the vaccination capacity will be zero.  The next
    day and forward, the vaccination capacity is 1 unit per day.  The vaccine
    produces immunity immediately, and the immunity lasts 5 days.

    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
     - On day 1 units 0 (sheep) and 2 (pigs) will be latent.  There will be no
       shipments because the movement rate multiplier is 0.
     - On day 2 units 0 and 2 will be Infectious Clinical.  Unit 2 (pigs) will
       be detected and marked for destruction.  The 5 km radius vaccination
       ring drawn around unit 2 will not be large enough to cover unit 1.
     - On day 3 (1 day after the first detection) the movement rate multiplier
       will be 1.  Unit 0 (sheep) will ship to and infect unit 1 (cattle).
       Unit 2 will be destroyed.
     - On day 4 unit 1 will be Latent.

    The latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness lasts 3 days, clinical signs
    accompany infectiousness immediately, and natural immunity lasts 3 days.

    There is no spread.
    
    The probability of detecting a diseased unit vs. the number of days the
    animals have been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1. The probability of
    detecting a diseased unit vs. the number of days since a public
    announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    A vaccination program begins at the first detection.  The authorities will
    vaccinate units within 10 km of a detected unit.  On the first 4 days that
    vaccinations could occur, the vaccination capacity will be zero.  The next
    day and forward, the vaccination capacity is 1 unit per day.  The vaccine
    produces immunity immediately, and the immunity lasts 5 days.

    There is no destruction.

    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
     - On day 1 unit 0 will be latent.
     - On day 2 unit 0 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected, and
       unit 1 will be marked for vaccination because it is within 10 km of a
       detected unit.
     - Day 3 is the first day that vaccinations could happen, but there will be
       no vaccination capacity for 4 days.
     - On day 4 there will be no vaccination capacity for another 3 days.
     - On day 5 unit 0 will no longer be infectious.  However, the simulation
       will keep going because there are still vaccination tasks to be done.
       There will be no vaccination capacity for another 2 days.
     - On day 6 there will be no vaccination capacity for another 1 day.
     - On day 7 unit 1 will be vaccinated.
     - On day 8 unit 1's state will show as Immune.  Because there are no
       infectious units left and nothing left to do, the simulation can end.

    Test that the simulation's early-exit rules are followed with respect to
    units waiting for vaccination.
    
    In the tests "early exit" 1-3, there are two units.  Unit 0 is infected.
    On day 1 unit 0 is detected and unit 1 is marked for vaccination.
    Different effects can be observed when a) there are resources to vaccinate
    unit 1 immediately, b) there are no resources to vaccinate unit 1 at first,
    but resources eventually come on-line, or c) there are never resources to
    vaccinate unit 1.

    In this scenario, there are never resources to vaccinate unit 1.

  <description>
    Test that the simulation's early-exit rules are followed with respect to
    units waiting for vaccination.
    
    In the tests "early exit" 4-6, there are three units.  Unit 0 is infected.
    On day 1 unit 0 is detected and units 1 and 2 are marked for vaccination.
    Different effects can be observed when a) there are resources to vaccinate
    both units, b) there are resources to vaccinate one unit, then later there
    are resources to vaccinate the other, or c) there are resources to
    vaccinate one unit, but never resources to vaccinate the other.

    In this scenario, there are resources to vaccinate one unit, then later
    there are resources to vaccinate the other.

  <parameter-description>
    For all production types, the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness
    lasts 3 days, clinical signs accompany infectiousness immediately, and
    natural immunity lasts 3 days.

    There is no spread.
    
    The probability of detecting a diseased unit vs. the number of days the
    animals have been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1. The probability of
    detecting a diseased unit vs. the number of days since a public
    announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    A vaccination program begins at the first detection.  The authorities will
    vaccinate units within 20 km of a detected unit.  On the first 4 days that
    vaccinations could occur, the vaccination capacity will be zero.  The next
    day, the vaccination capacity is 1 unit.  Another day of zero capacity
    follows, then on the next day and forward the vaccination capacity is 1
    unit per day.  Cattle have priority over pigs.  The vaccine produces
    immunity immediately, and the immunity lasts 5 days.

    There is no destruction.

    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
     - On day 1 unit 0 will be latent.
     - On day 2 unit 0 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected, and
       units 1 and 2 will be marked for vaccination because they are within 20
       km of a detected unit.
     - Day 3 is the first day that vaccinations could happen, but there will be
       no vaccination capacity for 4 days.
     - On day 4 there will be no vaccination capacity for another 3 days.
     - On day 5 unit 0 will no longer be infectious.  However, the simulation
       will keep going because there are still vaccination tasks to be done.
       There will be no vaccination capacity for another 2 days.
     - On day 6 there will be no vaccination capacity for another 1 day.
     - On day 7 there is capacity to vaccinate 1 unit.  Unit 1 will be chosen
       because cattle have priority over pigs.
     - On day 8 unit 1's state will show as Immune.  There is no capacity to
       vaccinate on day 8.
     - On day 9 there is capacity to vaccinate 1 unit.  Unit 2 will be
       vaccinated.
     - On day 10 unit 2's state will show as Immune.  Because there are no
       infectious units left and nothing left to do, the simulation can end.

     - On day 8 unit 1's state will show as Immune.  There is no capacity to

       2 waited 7 days).
     - On day 10 unit 2's state will show as Immune.  Because there are no
       infectious units left and nothing left to do, the simulation can end.

  <description>
    Test that the simulation's early-exit rules are followed with respect to
    units waiting for vaccination.
    
    In the tests "early exit" 4-6, there are three units.  Unit 0 is infected.
    On day 1 unit 0 is detected and units 1 and 2 are marked for vaccination.
    Different effects can be observed when a) there are resources to vaccinate
    both units, b) there are resources to vaccinate one unit, then later there
    are resources to vaccinate the other, or c) there are resources to
    vaccinate one unit, but never resources to vaccinate the other.

    In this scenario, there are resources to vaccinate one unit, but never
    resources to vaccinate the other.

    For all production types, the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness
    lasts 3 days, clinical signs accompany infectiousness immediately, and
    natural immunity lasts 3 days.

    There is no spread.
    
    The probability of detecting a diseased unit vs. the number of days the
    animals have been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1. The probability of
    detecting a diseased unit vs. the number of days since a public
    announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    A vaccination program begins at the first detection.  The authorities will
    vaccinate units within 20 km of a detected unit.  On the first 4 days that
    vaccinations could occur, the vaccination capacity will be zero.  The next
    day, the vaccination capacity is 1 unit.  All subsequent days have zero
    capacity.  Cattle have priority over pigs.  The vaccine produces immunity
    immediately, and the immunity lasts 5 days.

    There is no destruction.

    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
     - On day 1 unit 0 will be latent.
     - On day 2 unit 0 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected, and
       units 1 and 2 will be marked for vaccination because they are within 20
       km of a detected unit.
     - Day 3 is the first day that vaccinations could happen, but there will be
       no vaccination capacity for 4 days.
     - On day 4 there will be no vaccination capacity for another 3 days.
     - On day 5 unit 0 will no longer be infectious.  However, the simulation
       will keep going because there are still vaccination tasks to be done.
       There will be no vaccination capacity for another 2 days.
     - On day 6 there will be no vaccination capacity for another 1 day.
     - On day 7 there is capacity to vaccinate 1 unit.  Unit 1 will be chosen
       because cattle have priority over pigs.
     - On day 8 unit 1's state will show as Immune.  Because there are no
       infectious units left and nothing left to do, the simulation can end.

       still be 5 because it counts only completed vaccinations.  Because there
       are no infectious units left and nothing left to do, the simulation can

    Test that the vaccination waiting list is updated correctly when a unit is
    destroyed while awaiting vaccination.
    
    In the tests "destroyed while waiting" 1-3, there are two units.  Unit 0 is
    infected.  On day 1 unit 0 is detected and unit 1 is marked for both
    vaccination and destruction.  Different effects can be observed when a)
    vaccination happens before destruction, b) destruction happens before
    vaccination, or c) vaccination and destruction actions come up on the same
    day.

    In this scenario, vaccination happens before destruction.

    The latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness lasts 3 days, clinical signs
    accompany infectiousness immediately, and natural immunity lasts 3 days.

    There is no spread.
    
    The probability of detecting a diseased unit vs. the number of days the
    animals have been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1. The probability of
    detecting a diseased unit vs. the number of days since a public
    announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    At the first detection, vaccination and destruction programs begin.  The
    authorities will both vaccinate and destroy units within 10 km of a
    detected unit.  (This might not be a sensible strategy, but it is a useful
    setup for this test.)  On the first 4 days that vaccinations could occur,
    the vaccination capacity will be zero.  The next day and forward, the
    vaccination capacity is 1 unit per day.  The vaccine produces immunity
    immediately, and the immunity lasts 5 days.

    On the first 6 days that destructions could occur, the destruction capacity
    will be zero.  The next day and forward, the destruction capacity is 1 unit
    per day.

    Test that the vaccination waiting list is updated correctly when a unit is
    destroyed while awaiting vaccination.
    
    In the tests "destroyed while waiting" 1-3, there are two units.  Unit 0 is
    infected.  On day 1 unit 0 is detected and unit 1 is marked for both
    vaccination and destruction.  Different effects can be observed when a)
    vaccination happens before destruction, b) destruction happens before
    vaccination, or c) vaccination and destruction actions come up on the same
    day.

    In this scenario, destruction happens before vaccination.

    For cattle units, the latent period lasts 1 day, the infectious clinical

    the latent period lasts 3 days.

    For both production types, the probability of detection vs. the number of

    The vaccine produces immunity immediately, and the immunity lasts 5 days.
    The authorities can vaccinate or destroy an unlimited/very large number of
    units each day.

     - On day 1 the infected units (0 and 1) will be Latent.
     - On day 2 unit 0 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected and

  <parameter-description>
    For both cattle and pigs, the latent period lasts 1 day, the infectious
    clinical period lasts 2 days, and immunity lasts 3 days.

    For both production types, the probability of detection vs. the number of
    days a unit has been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The probability
    of detection vs. the number of days since a public announcement of an
    outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    When a diseased unit is detected, all units within 2.5 km will be
    vaccinated, excluding detected ones.  The vaccine produces immunity
    immediately, and the immunity lasts 5 days. The authorities can vaccinate
    an unlimited/very large number of units each day.

    There is no spread or destruction.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 the infected units (0 and 1) will be Latent.
     - On day 2 units 0 and 1 will be Infectious Clinical.  They will be
       detected and both units will trigger vaccination rings.  We don't commit
       to which detection should come "first", but the day's final count for
       units awaiting vaccination should be 4.
     - On day 3 units 2, 3, 4 and 5 will be vaccinated.

    The probability of detection vs. the number of days a unit has been showing
    clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The probability of detection vs. the number
    of days since a public announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    When a diseased unit is detected, all units of types C-G within 5 km will
    be marked for both vaccination and destruction.  (This might not be a
    sensible strategy, but it is a useful setup for this test.)  The authorities
    can destroy 1 unit per day.  Vaccination capacity does not come on-line
    until after all units are destroyed in this scenario.

    There is no spread.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 the infected units (0 and 1) will be Latent.
     - On day 2 units 0 and 1 will be Infectious Clinical.  They will be
       detected and both units will trigger vaccination rings.  Units 4-8 will
       be marked for both vaccination and destruction.
     - On days 3-7, one of the waiting units will be destroyed each day.  The

    For production type A, the latent period lasts 1 day, the infectious
    clinical period lasts 1 day, and immunity lasts 3 days.  The same is true
    for production type C.  Production types D-G each have one additional day
    on the latent period: 2 days for D, 3 days for E, etc.

    Airborne spread can occur from units of type A to units of types C-G.
    The probability of airborne spread at 1 km is 0.8723 and it drops off
    exponentially.  This parameter gives a 0.505 probability of infection at 5
    km (0.8723&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.505).

    The probability of detection vs. the number of days a unit has been showing
    clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The probability of detection vs. the number
    of days since a public announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    When a diseased unit is detected, all units of types C-G within 5 km will
    be marked for vaccination.  Vaccination capacity does not come on-line
    until after all units are detected in this scenario.

    There is no destruction.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 the infected units (0 and 1) will be Latent.
     - On day 2 units 0 and 1 will be Infectious Clinical.  They will be
       detected and both units will trigger vaccination rings.  Units 4-8 will
       be marked for vaccination.  Airborne spread from units 0 and 1 will
       infect units 4-8.
     - On day 3 the newly-infected units (4-8) will be Latent.
     - On days 4-8, one of the waiting units will become Infectious Clinical
       and be detected each day.  The count of units awaiting vaccination
       should drop by 1 each day.

    The parameters are identical to "destroyed while waiting, check count of
    units waiting" above.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 the infected units (0 and 1) will be Latent.
     - On day 2 units 0 and 1 will be Infectious Clinical.  They will be
       detected and both units will trigger vaccination rings.  Units 4-8 will
       be marked for both vaccination and destruction.  Unit-days and
       animal-days in queue will be 0 on this day: units are in queue, but no
       unit has spent a day in queue yet.
     - On days 3-7, one of the waiting units will be destroyed each day.  On
       day 3, the number of unit-days in queue will be 5 (one day each for the
       1 unit that was destroyed today and the 4 that are still in queue).
       Each unit has 25 animals, so the number of animal-days in queue will
       always be the unit-days multiplied by 25.  Note that days spent in the
       vaccination queue accumulate even though the vaccinations are being
       canceled.
     - On day 4, the number of unit-days in queue will increase by 4, to 9
       (one additional day each for the 1 unit that was destroyed today and the
       3 that are still in queue).
     - On day 5, the number of unit-days in queue will increase by 3, to 12.
     - On day 6, the number of unit-days in queue will increase by 2, to 14.
     - On day 7, the number of unit-days in queue will increase by 1, to 15.
       No more units are in queue, so the total number of unit-days in queue
       will remain at 15 on subsequent days.

    The latent period lasts 1 day, the infectious clinical period lasts 1 day,
    and immunity lasts 3 days.

    The probability of detection vs. the number of days a unit has been showing
    clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The probability of detection vs. the number
    of days since a public announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    The authorities will vaccinate units within 10 km of a detected unit.  The
    vaccine produces immunity immediately and the immunity lasts 5 days. The
    authorities can vaccinate 1 unit each day, starting 2 days after the 1st
    detection.

    There is no spread or destruction.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 unit 2 will be Latent.  Unit 0 will already be vaccine immune.
     - On day 2 unit 2 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected and
       unit 1 will be marked for vaccination because it is within 10 km.
     - On day 4 unit 1 will be vaccinated, and the average wait time should be
       2 (1 unit committed to vaccinate on day 2, vaccinated on day 4).  The
       initially vaccine immune unit, which did not wait at all, should not
       lower that number.

    For sheep and cattle, the latent period lasts 1 day, the infectious
    clinical period lasts 1 day, and immunity lasts 3 days.  For cattle, the
    latent period lasts 4 days and the other durations are the same.  For pigs,
    the latent period lasts 3 days and the other durations are the same.

    There is airborne spread from sheep units to cattle units, with exponential
    dropoff and p of spread at 1 km = 0.934.  (This makes the p of spread at 10
    km = 0.505, so with fixed "random" numbers of 0.5, spread will occur at 10
    km.)

    The probability of detection vs. the number of days a unit has been showing
    clinical signs is fixed at 1 for sheep and pigs, and 0 for cattle.  The
    probability of detection vs. the number of days since a public announcement
    of an outbreak is fixed at 1.

    All units within 11 km of a detected unit will be vaccinated.  Vaccination
    resources allow for 1 unit to be vaccinated 4 days after the first
    detection, and another unit 6 days after the first detection.  The vaccine
    produces immunity immediately and the immunity lasts 2 days.

    There is no spread or destruction.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 the infected units (0 and 2) will be Latent.
     - On day 2 unit 0 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will infect unit 1.  It
       will be detected and will trigger a vaccination ring.  Unit 1 will be
       marked for vaccination. The output vacwU will show 1 vaccination to
       do.
     - On day 3 the output vacwUDaysInQueue will show 1 (1 unit has spent 1 day
       in queue).
     - On day 4 unit 2 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected and
       will trigger a vaccination ring.  Unit 1 will again be marked for
       vaccination.  The output vacwU will show 2 vaccinations to do (of the
       same unit, but 2 vaccinations nonetheless).  The output vacwUDaysInQueue
       will show 2 (1 unit has spent 2 days in queue).
     - On day 5 the output vacwUDaysInQueue will show 3 (1 unit has spent 3
       days in queue).  Note that we are in the overlap between the unit's 2
       stints in queue right now, but this output does not double-count units 
       in that situation.
     - On day 6 (4 days after the first detection), there will be resources to
       vaccinate 1 unit.  Unit 1 will be vaccinated.  The vaccination will have
       no effect because unit 1 is already Latent.
     - On day 7 unit 1 will be Infectious Clinical, but it will not be detected
       because the probability of detection for cattle units is 0.
     - On day 8 (6 days after the first detection), there will be resources to
       vaccinate 1 unit.  Unit 1 will be vaccinated again.

    There  can be more than one means of detection.  In this test, the
    threshold for vaccination is 3 detected units.  Two units are detected, the
    first by clinical signs, the second by clinical signs &lt;i&gt;and&lt;/i&gt;
    a positive test result on the same day.  No vaccinations should be done,
    because only 2 units have been detected (the unit that is detected twice
    should not count twice toward the vaccination threshold).

    This test failed in version 3.2.5 and was fixed in 3.2.6.

    For sheep (unit 0), the infectious subclinical period lasts 1 day, the
    infectious clinical period lasts 1 day, and immunity lasts 5 days.  For
    cattle (unit 1) and pigs (unit 2), the latent period lasts 1 day, the
    infectious clinical period lasts 1 day, and immunity lasts 5 days.

    Sheep units send 1 shipment per day to cattle units.  The distance of
    shipment is 10 km, and the probability of infection is 1.  There are no
    other kinds of contact.

    Diseased units will be detected (by self-reporting) on their first day
    showing clinical signs.

    Direct contacts out of a detected unit will be traced.  There is no
    delay to trace, and tracing success is 100%.  Units found by trace will be
    examined; if no signs of disease are detected, they will be tested.  A
    test requires 1 day and has 100% sensitivity and specificity.

    Vaccination begins when disease has been detected in 3 units.  Pig units
    within 15 km of a diseased cattle unit will be vaccinated.  Vaccination
    resources allow for 10 units to be vaccinated per day.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 unit 0 will be Infectious Subclinical.  It will ship to and
       infect unit 1.
     - On day 2 unit 1 will be Latent.  Unit 0 will be Infectious Clinical.
       Unit 0 will be detected.  Because it is a sheep unit, it will not
       trigger a vaccination ring.  However, it will trigger a trace, which
       will lead to unit 1.  Unit 1 will be examined, but no clinical signs of
       disease will be found (it is still Latent).  A test will be ordered.
     - On day 3 unit 1 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected by
       clinical signs.  Also on this day, a positive test result will come back
       for unit 1.  However, since only 1 units have been detected up to this
       point, no vaccination will be done.

  <description>
    This test is one of a set to test triggering vaccination on number of
    detections.  There are 4 units of type A, A, B, and C, which get detected
    one per day.  Above those are a row of units of type D, which get
    vaccinated if/when a vaccination program is initiated.

    In this test, vaccination is triggered by detection of 1 unit of any type.

  <parameter-description>
    For all production types, there is no latent period and the clinical
    period lasts 10 days.

    Airborne spread is set up such that infection will spread from unit 1
    (lower row, far left) across the lower row, with 1 new unit infected each
    day. Detection occurs on the first day clinical.

    Vaccination begins when disease has been detected in 1 unit of any type.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 unit 1 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected and
       a vaccination program will be initiated.
     - On day 2 the top row of units will be vaccinated.  The simulation
       is deliberately stopped at this point.

    Vaccination begins when disease has been detected in 4 units over 3 days

  <short-name>trigger on 6 detections over 4 days, any type, reach equivalent rate 1.5 by 2 days</short-name>

  <description>
    This test is one of a set to test triggering vaccination on rate of
    detections.  There are 8 units of types A-H, all starting latent, so the
    disease parameters can be manipulated to produce any number of newly
    Clinical units to detect on a particular day.  The “H” unit is the one that

    In this test, vaccination is triggered by detection of 6 units over 4 days,
    any production type. The equivalent rate (1.5 units per day) is reached
    after only 2 days, but that should not trigger detection, since the point
    of counting the number of detections over 4 days is to smooth out spikes.

  <description>
    This test is one of a set to test triggering vaccination a given number of
    days after the first detection.  There are 8 units of types A-H, all
    starting latent, so the disease parameters can be manipulated to produce
    any number of newly Clinical units to detect on a particular day.  The “H”
    unit is the one that gets vaccinated.

    In this test, vaccination is triggered 2 days after the first detection in
    any production type.

    Detection occurs on the first day clinical.

    Vaccination begins 2 days after the first detection, based on detections
    in units of any type.

    What should happen:
     - Day 1: 0 detections.
     - Day 2: 1 detection. First detection.
     - Day 3: 1 detection. 1 day after 1st detection.
     - Day 4: 0 detections. 2 days after 1st detection. The “H” unit will be
       vaccinated on this day.  The simulation is deliberately stopped at this

    For production type A, the infectious subclinical period is 1 day, and the latent
    period is 30 days.  This ensures that only unit 2 will be detected during this
    simulation.

    For production type B, the latent and infectious subclinical period are both 1 day,
    and then the herd goes directly to immune.  This ensures that neither of the B units
    will be detected during this simulation.
    
    Vaccination begins after 1 detection.  There is capacity to vaccinate 1 unit per
    day.
    
    There is no rule for stopping vaccination.

    What should happen:
     - Day 1: Unit 2 will be subclinical.
     - Day 2: Unit 2 will be clinical.  It will be detected and this will initiate a
       vaccination program.
     - Days 3-8: On each day, 1 “C” unit will be vaccinated.

    For production type A, the infectious subclinical period is 1 day, and the latent
    period is 30 days.  This ensures that only unit 2 will be detected during this
    simulation.

    For production type B, the latent and infectious subclinical period are both 1 day,
    and then the herd goes directly to immune.  This ensures that neither of the B units
    will be detected during this simulation.
    
    Vaccination begins after 1 detection.  There is capacity to vaccinate 1 unit per
    day.
    
    Vaccination is stopped after 3 days with no detections.

    What should happen:
     - Day 1: Unit 2 will be subclinical.
     - Day 2: Unit 2 will be clinical.  It will be detected and this will initiate a
       vaccination program.
     - Days 3-5: On each day, 1 “C” unit will be vaccinated, for a total of 3 units.
       Since there are no new detections during these 3 days, vaccination will be
       stopped.
     - Day 6: There should be no more vaccinations from this day forward.

  <description>
    This test is one of a set to test stopping and restarting vaccination.  There are 2
    rings of units of type C and D; these are the units that will get vaccinated.  Inside
    the first ring are 2 units of type A, and inside the second ring are 2 units of type B.

    In this test, there is 1 detection (which triggers vaccination), another detection 2
    days later, and 3 days after that vaccination is stopped.

  <description>
    This test is one of a set to test retrospective vaccination.  There are 2 rows of
    units, cattle across the bottom and pigs across the top.  Infection spreads across
    the row of cattle units, resulting in 1 detection per day when the units are turning
    Clinical.  When a cattle unit is detected, a small vaccination circle is drawn,
    covering just the pig unit directly above that cattle unit.

    In this test, vaccination is initiated once 3 infected units have been detected.
    Retrospective vaccination is given as 0 days.

    For cattle (the bottom row of units), the latent period lasts 1 day, then the unit
    becomes infectious clinical.  Direct contact spread is set up such that each unit

    Diseased cattle units will be detected (by self-reporting) on their first day
    showing clinical signs.
    
    Vaccination begins when disease has been detected in 3 units.  Retrospective
    vaccination is set at 0 days.  Pig units within 0.75 km of a detected unit will be
    vaccinated.  Vaccination resources allow for 1 unit to be vaccinated per day.

    What should happen:
     - Day 1: Unit 0 will be latent.  It will infect unit 1.
     - Day 2-5: On each of these days, a detection will occur, starting with unit 0 on
       day 2 and ending with unit 3 on day 5.
     - Day 4: The 3rd detection (unit 2) occurs on this day.  A vaccination program will
       be initiated, and the pig unit directly above unit 2 (unit 6) will be added to the
       vaccination queue.
     - Day 5: Unit 6 will be vaccinated (its state will show as vaccine immune on day 6).
       Unit 3 is detected on this day, and unit 7 is added to the vaccination queue.

  <parameter-description>
    For sheep, the latent period lasts 1 day, the infectious subclinical period
    lasts 1 day, the infectious clinical period lasts 1 day. For cattle, the
    latent period lasts 1 day and the infectious clinical period lasts 2 days.
    For pigs, the latent period lasts 1 day and the infectious clinical period
    lasts 3 days. Immunity lasts 10 days for all types.

    For sheep, the probability of detection vs. the number of days a unit has
    been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1. The probability of reporting vs.
    the number of days since a public announcement of an outbreak is also fixed
    at 1. For cattle and pigs, the probability of detection vs. the number of
    days a unit has been showing clinical signs is fixed at 0.4, and the
    probability of reporting vs. the number of days since a public announcement
    of an outbreak is fixed at 1.

    When a diseased unit is detected, a trace out of direct contacts is
    initiated. The probability of success is 100% but there is a 3-day delay
    for trace results. Units identified by trace are examined for clinical
    signs; probability of detection is 2x the normal probability for
    self-reporting. If the exam does not detect clinical signs, a lab test is
    done. Tests have 100% sensitivity and specificity, and test results are
    available immediately.

    When a diseased pig unit is detected, all units within 15 km will be
    vaccinated, excluding detected ones. The delay to immunity is 2 days, and
    the immunity lasts 5 days. The authorities can vaccinate 3 units per day.

    There is no spread or destruction.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 unit 0 (sheep) will be Latent.
     - On day 2 unit 0 will be Infectious Subclinical. It will expose and
       infect units 1 and 2 by direct contact.
     - On day 3 unit 0 will be Infectious Clinical. It will be detected and a
       trace of direct contacts will be initiated. Units 1 and 2 will be
       Latent.
     - On day 4 units 1 and 2 will be Infectious Clinical, but the probability
       of detection is too low for them to be detected.
     - On day 5 units 1 and 2 will be Infectious Clinical, but the probability
       of detection is too low for them to be detected.
     - On day 6 unit 1 (cattle) will be Naturally Immune and unit 2 (pigs) will
       still be Infectious Clinical. The probability of detection for unit 2 is
       still too low for it to be detected. The results of the trace initiated
       on day 3 will become available and cause both units 1 and 2 to be
       examined. Unit 2 will be detected, which will trigger a vaccination ring
       that includes unit 1. Unit 1 will not be detected by clinical signs (it
       is immune now) so it will be tested. The test will come back positive
       and that will cancel the request for vaccination of unit 1. It is at
       this point that the bug will show, because the vaccination list monitor
       may process the “vaccination canceled” event before it processes the
       “request for vaccination” event.
     - Nothing more of interest happens on day 7.

  <short-name>re-trigger on 2 detections in any type</short-name>

  <description>
    This test is one of a set to test re-triggering vaccination.  There are 2
    rings of units of type C and D; these are the units that will get
    vaccinated.  Inside the first ring are 2 units of type A, and inside the
    second ring are 2 units of type B.

    In this test, 2 “A” units are detected, triggering vaccination the first
    time.  Vaccination is ended, then 2 “B” units are detected.  The fact that
    vaccination does not start until the 2nd “B” unit is detected shows that
    the trigger has reset properly between starts of the vaccination program.

    For production type A, the infectious subclinical period is 1 day, and the
    latent period is 1 day.  This ensures that both “A” units at the center of
    circle 1 will be detected, one day apart.

    For production type B, the infectious subclinical period is 7 days, and the
    latent period is 1 day.  This ensures that both “B” units at the center of
    circle 2 will be detected, also one day apart, but later in the simulation.

    Diseased units will be detected (by self-reporting) on their first day
    showing clinical signs.
    
    Vaccination begins when disease has been detected in 2 units of any type.
    Units within 1.5 km of a detected unit will be vaccinated. The first time
    vaccination is initiated, there is capacity to vaccinate 1 unit per day.
    The second time vaccination is initiated (and subsequent times), the
    vaccination capacity goes 1 unit on the first day, 2 units on the second
    day, and 3 units on the third day and forward.

    Vaccination is stopped after 3 days with no detections.

    What should happen:
     - Day 1: The “A” units will be latent and subclinical, not detectable yet.
     - Day 2: 1 “A” unit will be clinical. It will be detected.
     - Day 3: The other “A” unit will be clinical. It will be detected and a
       vaccination program will be initiated.
     - Day 4-6: On each of these days, a unit in circle 1 will be vaccinated.
     - Day 7: 3 days have passed with no new detections, so vaccination is
       stopped. No units will be vaccinated on this day.
     - Day 8: 1 “B” unit will be clinical. It will be detected. For the
       trigger, which has been reset post-ending of the vaccination program,
       this counts as the first detection.
     - Day 9: The other “B” unit will be subclinical. It will be detected and
       the vaccination program will be restarted.
     - Day 10: 2 units in circle 2 will be vaccinated.  Note that
       *two* units are vaccinated: the restart capacity chart
       goes 1,2,3,... but it is relative to the day of first detection, which
       was 2 days ago on day 7.
     - Day 11: 3 units in circle 2 will be vaccinated.
     - Day 12: The remaining 1 unit in circle 2 will be vaccinated.

    that the first detection of a “B” unit occurs, the 6 day period also covers

    This test is one of a set to test re-triggering vaccination.  There are 2
    rings of units of type C and D; these are the units that will get
    vaccinated.  Inside the first ring are 2 units of type A, and inside the
    second ring are 2 units of type B.

    In this test, vaccination is triggered either a) 3 days after detection in
    any type, or b) 7 days after detection in type “B”. One “A” unit and one
    “B” unit are detected early in the simulation, triggering vaccination to
    begin 3 days later.  Vaccination is ended, then a “B” unit is detected 3
    days later. The fact that vaccination does not start until 7 days after the
    2nd “B” unit is detected shows that the time-since-detection trigger has
    reset properly between starts of the vaccination program.

    For production type A, the infectious subclinical period is 1 day, and the
    latent period is 30 days. This ensures that only one “A” unit gets
    detected.

    For production type B, the infectious subclinical period is 1 day, and the
    latent period is 8 days. This ensures that one “B” unit gets detected early
    in the simulation, and the other several days later.

    Diseased units will be detected (by self-reporting) on their first day
    showing clinical signs.
    
    Vaccination begins when 3 days have passed since the first detection in
    any type or 7 days have passed since the first detection in type B. Units
    within 1.5 km of a detected unit will be vaccinated. Retrospective
    vaccination is set at 7 days. There is capacity to vaccinate 1 unit per
    day.

    Vaccination is stopped after 3 days with no detections.

    What should happen:
     - Day 1: No units are clinical yet, no detections.
     - Day 2: 1 “A” unit and 1 “B” unit will be clinical. They will be detected.
     - Day 3: 1 day after 1st detection.
     - Day 4. 2 days after 1st detection.
     - Day 5. 3 days after 1st detection. On this day, and days 6-7, one “C”
       will be vaccinated each day.
     - Day 8: 3 days of the vaccination program have passed with no new
       detections, so vaccination is stopped. No units will be vaccinated on
       this day.
     - Day 9: It is now 7 days since the detection of the “B” unit on day 2.
       But the trigger has been reset post-ending of the vaccination program,
       so that detection has been forgotten.
       new detection counts as the first one.
     - Day 10: The remaining “B” unit will be clinical. It will be detected.
       This is the first detection post-ending of the vaccination program.
     - Day 17: This is the 7th day after the detection of the “B” unit. On this
       day, and days 18-19, one “D” unit will be vaccinated each day.
     - Day 20: 3 days of the vaccination program have passed with no new
       detections, so vaccination is stopped. No units will be vaccinated on
       this day.

    This test is one of a set to test re-triggering vaccination.  There are 2
    rings of units of type C and D; these are the units that will get
    vaccinated.  Inside the first ring are 2 units of type A, and inside the
    second ring are 6 units of type B.

    In this test, vaccination is triggered either a) 1 day after the first
    detection, or b) by an EDR of 1.5 or higher, measured by detections of “B” 
    units in the last 3 days divided by detections in the 3 days before that.
    One “A” and one “B” unit are detected early in the simulation, triggering
    vaccination to begin 1 day later.  Vaccination is ended, then 2 “B” units
    are detected. The fact that vaccination does not start until additional “B” 
    units are detected shows that the EDR trigger has reset properly between
    starts of the vaccination program.

    For production type A, the infectious subclinical period is 1 day, and the
    latent period is 30 days.  This ensures that only one “A” unit gets
    detected, early in the simulation.

    For production type B, all of the units start subclinical, and the units’
    days left in state are set so that there will be this number of detections
    over the sequence of days: 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 0, 2.

    Diseased units will be detected (by self-reporting) on their first day
    showing clinical signs.
    
    Vaccination begins when either a) 1 day has passed since the first
    detection, or b) the EDR is 1.5 or higher, measured by detections of “B” 
    units in the last 3 days divided by detections in the 3 days before that.
    Units within 1.5 km of a detected unit will be vaccinated. Retrospective
    vaccination is set at 3 days. There is capacity to vaccinate 1 unit per
    day.

    Vaccination is stopped after 3 days with no detections.

    What should happen:
     - Day 1: No units are clinical yet, no detections.
     - Day 2: 1 “A” unit and 1 “B” unit will be clinical. They will be
       detected.
     - Day 3: 1 day after 1st detection. On this day, and days 4-5, one “C”
       unit will be vaccinated each day.
     - Day 6: 3 days of the vaccination program have passed with no new
       detections, so vaccination is stopped. No units will be vaccinated on
       this day.
     - Day 7: 2 “B” units will be clinical. They will be detected. Note that if
       you counted the “B” unit detected back on day 2, the EDR would now be
       2.0. But the EDR trigger has been reset post-ending of the vaccination
       program, so these new detections count as the first ones.
     - Day 8: 1 “B” unit will be clinical. It will be detected. EDR =
       (1+2+0)/(0+0+0) = undefined.
     - Day 9: No new detections. EDR = (0+1+2)/(0+0+0) = undefined.
     - Day 10: 2 “B” units will be clinical. They will be detected. EDR =
       (2+0+1)/(2+0+0) = 1.5. The vaccination program will be restarted.
     - Day 11-13: One unit will be vaccinated each day. The simulation is
       deliberately stopped at 13 days.

    contains types “A” and “C”, and the other group contains types “B” and “D”.
    One “A” unit is detected early in the simulation, triggering vaccination to
    begin 3 days later.  Vaccination is ended, then a “B” unit is detected,
    then an “A” unit the next day. The fact that vaccination does not start
    until the 2nd “A” unit is detected shows that the number-of-groups trigger
    has reset properly between starts of the vaccination program.

    For production type A, the infectious subclinical period is 1 day, and the

    For production type B, the infectious subclinical period is 8 days, and the

    Diseased units will be detected (by self-reporting) on their first day
    showing clinical signs.
    
    Vaccination begins when either a) 3 days have passed since the first

    vaccination is set at 3 days. There is capacity to vaccinate 1 unit per
    day.

    Vaccination is stopped after 3 days with no detections.

    What should happen:
     - Day 1: No units are clinical yet, no detections.
     - Day 2: 1 “A” unit will be clinical. It will be detected.
     - Day 3: 1 day after 1st detection.

     - Day 8: 3 days of the vaccination program have passed with no new
       detections, so vaccination is stopped. No units will be vaccinated on

     - Day 9: 1 “B” unit will be clinical. It will be detected. Note that if
       you counted the “A” unit detected back on day 2, there would now be
       detections in 2 production type groups.  But the number-of-groups
       trigger has been reset post-ending of the vaccination program, so this
       new detection counts as the first one.
     - Day 10: The remaining “A” unit will be clinical. It will be detected and
       now there have been detections in 2 production type groups, so the
       vaccination program will be restarted.
     - Day 11-12: One unit will be vaccinated each day. The simulation is
       deliberately stopped at 12 days.

  <short-name>re-trigger on unit waiting 2 days for destruction, no new detection to anchor chart</short-name>

  <description>
    This test is one of a set to test re-triggering vaccination.  There are 2
    rings of units of type C and D; these are the units that will get
    vaccinated.  Inside the first ring are 2 units of type A, and inside the
    second ring are 2 units of type B.

    In this test, vaccination is triggered by any unit waiting 2 days for
    destruction.  The “A” units are used to activate the trigger.  One “A” unit
    is detected and marked for destruction early in the simulation.  Its wait
    time causes vaccination to be initiated.  Then vaccination is ended, and
    later in the simulation, the other “A” unit is marked for destruction
    because of a trace (not a new detection, but pre-emptive destruction of a
    trace).  The second “A” unit’s wait time causes vaccination to be
    re-initiated.  The day of re-initiation provides the anchor for day 0 on
    the axis of the vaccination capacity chart.

  <parameter-description>
    For production type A, the infectious subclinical period is 1 day, and the
    latent period is 30 days.  This ensures that one “A” unit gets detected
    early in the simulation, and the other several does not get detected.
    
    There is direct contact between “A” units, which creates dangerous
    contacts that can be traced.

    For production type B, the infectious subclinical period is 12 days, and
    the latent period is 30 days.  This ensures that only one “B” gets detected,
    later in the simulation.

    Diseased units will be detected (by self-reporting) on their first day
    showing clinical signs.

    Destruction of detected diseased units and destruction of traced direct
    contacts is enabled, but the destruction capacity is zero until 21 days
    have passed, which creates long wait times.

    Vaccination begins after any unit has been waiting 2 days for destruction.
    Retrospective vaccination is set at 2 days.
    The first time vaccination is initiated, vaccination capacity is 1 unit per
    day.  Vaccination is stopped after 3 days with no detections.  The second
    time vaccination is initiated, vaccination capacity goes up as 1,2,3 over
    the first 3 days and then remains at 3 units per day.

    What should happen:
     - Day 1: There is a contact from the subclinical “A” unit to the latent
       one.
     - Day 2: 1 “A” unit will be clinical. It will again send a contact to the
       other “A” unit. It will be detected and marked for destruction. A trace
       of direct contacts will be initiated. Vaccination will be requested for
       the ring around the “A” units.
     - Day 3: By the end of this day, the “A” unit counts as having been
       waiting for 1 day.
     - Day 4: The “A” unit counts as having been waiting for 2 days, so vaccination will be initiated.
     - Day 5: 1 unit will be vaccinated.
     - Day 6: 1 unit will be vaccinated.
     - Day 7: 1 unit will be vaccinated. There have been 5 days (days 3-7) with
       no new detections, so vaccination will be ended.
     - Day 8: nothing new happens.
     - Day 9: The trace initiated back on day 2 comes back with results, and
       the second “A” unit is marked for destruction.
     - Day 10: By the end of this day, the second “A” unit counts as having
       been waiting for 1 day.
     - Day 11: The second “A” unit counts as having been waiting for 2 days, so
       vaccination will be initiated. Note though that there are currently no
       units awaiting vaccination.
     - Day 12: If there were units to vaccinate, there would be capacity to
       vaccinate 1 today (because vaccination capacity is counted from day 11).
     - Day 13: If there were units to vaccinate, there would be capacity to
       vaccinate 2 today. One “B” unit is detected on this day and provides
       some units to vaccinate tomorrow.
     - Day 14: 3 of the units in the ring around the “B” unit will be
       vaccinated.  The simulation is deliberately stopped on this day.

    that will get vaccinated.  Inside the first ring are 2 units of type A, and
    inside the second ring are 2 units of type B.

    In this test, a trigger that requires 2 detections is active throughout the
    simulation. 2 “A” units are detected, triggering vaccination the first
    time.  Vaccination is ended, then 2 “B” units are detected, triggering
    vaccination the second time.

    For production type A, the infectious subclinical period is 1 day, and the
    latent period is 1 day.  This ensures that both “A” units at the center of
    circle 1 will be detected, one day apart.

    For production type B, the infectious subclinical period is 7 days, and the
    latent period is 1 day.  This ensures that both “B” units at the center of
    circle 2 will be detected, also one day apart, but later in the simulation.

    Diseased units will be detected (by self-reporting) on their first day
    showing clinical signs.
    
    Vaccination begins when disease has been detected in 2 units of any type.
    This applies to the first initiation of a vaccination program and any
    re-starts.  Units within 1.5 km of a detected unit will be vaccinated.
    There is capacity to vaccinate 1 unit per day.

    Vaccination is stopped after 3 days with no detections.

    What should happen:
     - Day 1: The “A” units will be latent and subclinical, not detectable yet.
     - Day 2: 1 “A” unit will be clinical. It will be detected.
     - Day 3: The other “A” unit will be clinical. It will be detected and a
       vaccination program will be initiated.
     - Day 4-6: On each of these days, a unit in circle 1 will be vaccinated.
     - Day 7: 3 days have passed with no new detections, so vaccination is
       stopped. No units will be vaccinated on this day.
     - Day 8: 1 “B” unit will be clinical. It will be detected. Note that since
       the trigger has been reset post-ending of the vaccination program, this
       new detection counts as the first one.
     - Day 9: The other “B” unit will be clinical. It will be detected and
       the vaccination program will be restarted.
     - Day 10-12: On each of these days, a unit in circle 2 will be vaccinated.
     - Day 13: 3 days have passed with no new detections, so vaccination is
       stopped. No units will be vaccinated on this day, and the simulation
       will exit.

    The parameters are the same as for “1st/restart trigger on 2 detections in
    any type” above, but this time the trigger applies only for the first
    initiation of a vaccination program, not for re-starts.

    What should happen:
     - Day 1: The “A” units will be latent and subclinical, not detectable yet.
     - Day 2: 1 “A” unit will be clinical. It will be detected.
     - Day 3: The other “A” unit will be clinical. It will be detected and a
       vaccination program will be initiated.
     - Day 4-6: On each of these days, a unit in circle 1 will be vaccinated.
     - Day 7: 3 days have passed with no new detections, so vaccination is
       stopped. No units will be vaccinated on this day.
     - Day 8: 1 “B” unit will be clinical. It will be detected. Note that since
       the trigger has been reset post-ending of the vaccination program, this
       new detection counts as the first one.
     - Day 9: The other “B” unit will be clinical. It will be detected but the
       trigger is no longer active and the vaccination program will not be
       restarted.
     - Day 10: Nothing new happens. The simulation exits.

  <description>
    This test is one of a set to test using different triggers for the first
    initiation of a vaccination program vs. re-starts of the vaccination
    program.  There are 2 rings of units of type C and D; these are the units
    that will get vaccinated.  Inside the first ring are 2 units of type A, and
    inside the second ring are 2 units of type B.

    In this test, a trigger that requires 2 detections is active only for
    re-starts of a vaccination program.  2 “A” units are detected, then later
    2 “B” units are detected, but since the only vaccination trigger defined
    does not apply to first initiation of a vaccination program, no vaccination
    program is ever initiated.

    initiation of a vaccination program vs. re-starts of the vaccination
    program.  There are 2 rings of units of type C and D; these are the units
    that will get vaccinated.  Inside the first ring are 2 units of type A, and

    In this test, a trigger that requires 2 detections is active only for the
    first initiation of a vaccination program, and a trigger that requires 1
    detection is active only for re-starts of a vaccination program.  2 “A”
    units are detected, triggering vaccination the first time.  Vaccination is
    ended, then 2 “B” units are detected. The first detection of a “B” unit
    re-starts the vaccination program.

    Units of type “B” are latent for 1 day, clinical for 1 day, then immune.
    Units of type “A” are latent for 4 days, clinical for 1 day, then immune.

    There is no disease spread.

    Diseased units are detected on the first day showing clinical signs.

    Vaccination is initiated after detection of 1 diseased unit.  A
    vaccination ring with inner radius 7/8 km and outer radius 1 1/8 km is
    created around a detected unit.  There is capacity to vaccinate 100 units
    per day. Vaccination is prioritized by time waiting (oldest requests first),
    then by size (largest first).

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 units A and B will be Latent.
     - On day 2 unit B will be Infectious Clinical. It will be detected, a
       vaccination program will be initiated, and all of the units in the right
       ring will be queued for vaccination.
     - Starting on day 3, one unit can be vaccinated each day. Going by unit
       size, the right ring will be vaccinated in this order: 7, 8, 9, 10, 11,
       12.  On day 3, unit 7 is vaccinated (its state will show as Vaccine
       Immune on day 4).
     - On day 4, vaccination of the right ring will continue with unit 8.
     - On day 5, unit A will be Infectious Clinical. It will be detected and
       the units in the left ring will be queued for vaccination. Vaccination
       of the right ring will continue with unit 9.
     - On day 6, there are quite a few units in the vaccination queue. Because
       time waiting (oldest first) has top priority, a unit from the right ring
       will be picked, and because size (largest first) has second priority,
       unit 10 will be picked.
     - On day 7, vaccinating in largest-first order around the right ring would
       bring us to unit 11. But since the overlapping vaccination ring was
       created around unit A, units 11 and 12 are now in the hole punched out
       of the right ring. Unit 1 will be vaccinated (the largest unit in the
       left ring).
     - On day 8, vaccinating in largest-first order around the left ring would
       bring us to unit 2. But units 2 and 3 are in the hole punched out of the
       left ring. So unit 4 will be vaccinated.
     - On day 9, vaccination of the left ring will continue with unit 5.
     - On day 10, vaccination of the left ring will continue with unit 6.
     - On day 11, nothing new happens: all the units that need to be vaccinated
       have been. This will be the last simulation day.

    Diseased units of production type “A” are latent for 1 day, clinical for 1
    day, then immune.

    There is no disease spread.

    Diseased units are detected on the first day showing clinical signs.

    Vaccination is initiated after detection of 1 diseased unit.  A suppressive
    vaccination ring of radius 3 1/3 km and a protective vaccination ring with
    inner radius 4.5 km and outer radius 6.5 km is created around a detected
    unit of production type “A”.
    
    There is capacity to vaccinate 100 units per day.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 unit 7 will be Latent.
     - On day 2 unit 7 will be Infectious Clinical. It will be detected, a
       vaccination program will be initiated, and suppressive and protective
       vaccination rings will be set up as shown in the diagram below.
     - On day 3 units 1, 2, 12, and 13 will be vaccinated because they are in
       the protective ring.  Units 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 10 will be vaccinated
       because they are in the suppressive ring.  (Their states will appear as
       Vaccine Immune on day 4.)
     - On day 4, there is nothing new to do.  This will be the last simulation
       day.

  <parameter-description>
    Diseased units are latent for 1 day, clinical for 1 day, then immune.

    There is no disease spread.

    Diseased units are detected on the first day showing clinical signs.

    Vaccination is initiated after detection of 1 diseased unit.  A suppressive
    vaccination ring of radius 3 1/3 km and a protective vaccination ring with
    inner radius 4.5 km and outer radius 6.5 km is created around a detected
    unit of production type “A”.  A suppressive vaccination ring of radius 1
    1/3 km and a protective vaccination ring with inner radius 2.5 km and outer
    radius 3.5 km is created around a detected unit of type “B”.
    
    There is capacity to vaccinate 100 units per day. Vaccination is
    prioritized by time waiting (oldest requests first).

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 units 7 and 12 will be Latent.
     - On day 2 units 7 and 12 will be Infectious Clinical. They will be
       detected, a vaccination program will be initiated, and suppressive and
       protective vaccination rings will be set up as shown in the diagrams
       below.
     - Looking at each unit and what should happen to it:
     - Units 1 and 2 are in the protective ring around unit 7: they will be
       vaccinated.
     - Unit 3 is in the gap between the protective and suppressive rings around
       unit 7: it will not be vaccinated.
     - Units 4, 5, 6, and 8 are in the suppressive ring around unit 7: they
       will be vaccinated.
     - Unit 9 is in the suppressive ring around unit 7 and the protective ring
       around unit 12: it will be vaccinated.
     - Unit 10 is in the gap between the protective and suppressive rings
       around unit 12, but it is also in the suppressive ring around unit 7: it
       will be vaccinated.
     - Unit 11 is in the gap between the protective and suppressive rings
       around unit 7, but it is also in the suppressive ring around unit 12: it
       will be vaccinated.
     - Unit 13 is in the suppressive ring around unit 12 and the protective
       ring around unit 7: it will be vaccinated.
     - Unit 14 is in the gap between the protective and suppressive rings
       around unit 12: it will not be vaccinated.
     - Unit 15 is in the protective ring around unit 12: it will be vaccinated.
     - On day 4, the units noted above will show as Vaccine Immune.  This will
       be the last simulation day.

    Test to verify a bug fix. In this test, a unit is vaccinated on the same
    day that it is marked for vaccination as part of a newly created ring.

  <parameter-description>
    Units of type “A” are latent for 1 day, clinical for 1 day, then immune.
    Units of type “B” are latent for 4 days, clinical for 1 day, then immune.

    There is no disease spread.

    Diseased units are detected on the first day showing clinical signs.

    Vaccination is initiated after detection of 1 diseased unit.  A
    vaccination ring with inner radius 7/8 km and outer radius 1 1/8 km is
    created around a detected “A” unit.  A vaccination ring with inner radius
    1/2 km and outer radius 1 1/8 km is created around a detected “B” unit.
    Round-robin priority is turned on, then vaccination is prioritized by size,
    with smaller units being vaccinated first.  There is capacity to vaccinate
    2 units per day.  The minimum time between re-vaccinations is 31 days.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 units A and B will be Latent.
     - On day 2 unit A will be Infectious Clinical. It will be detected and a
       vaccination program will be initiated.
     - On day 3, the two smallest units, 5 and 6, should be vaccinated. (Their
       state will show as Vaccine Immune on day 4.)
     - On day 4, units 3 and 4 should be vaccinated.
     - On day 5, units 2 and 1 should be vaccinated, completing the vaccination
       ring around unit A. Also on this day, unit B will be Infectious Clinical.
       It will be detected and a vaccination ring will be created.
     - Over the next several days, units 12 and 11 should be vaccinated, then
       10 and 9, then 8 and 7.  Units 2 and 3 will not be re-vaccinated because
       of the minimum time between re-vaccinations.  If the bug is present,
       however, then the program will crash when it considers unit 2 for
       vaccination (that is the unit that was re-added to the vaccination queue
       the same day it was vaccinated).
