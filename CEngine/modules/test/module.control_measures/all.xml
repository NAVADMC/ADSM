  <parameter-description>
    The latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness lasts 2 days, clinical signs
    accompany infectiousness immediately, and immunity lasts 3 days.
    
    The probability of detection vs. the number of days a unit has been showing
    clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The probability of detection vs. the number
    of days since a public announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.
    
    The authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The
    authorities can destroy an unlimited/very large number of units each day.
    
    There is no spread or vaccination.

    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
     - On day 1 all units will be Latent.
     - On day 2 all units will be Infectious Clinical.  They will be detected
       and slated for destruction.
     - On day 3 all units will be destroyed.  Their state will appear as
       Destroyed on day 4.

    The parameters are identical to "3 days to start destruction program, 1
    incr. to 4 units/day destruction limit" above.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 all the units will be Latent.
     - On day 2 all the units will be Infectious Clinical.  They will all be
       detected and marked for destruction.
     - On days 3, 4, and 5, nothing will happen.
     - On day 6 four units will be destroyed.  The average wait will be 4 (4
       units waited 4 days before destruction).
     - On day 7 the remaining four units will be destroyed.  The average wait
       will be (4x5+4x4)/8=4.5 (4 units waited 5 days before destruction, 4
       units waited 4 days before destruction).

    Test tracing out.  In this scenario, an infected unit ships animals to a
    neighbouring unit, then the source unit (but not the receiving unit) is
    detected.  In this, the base test scenario, there is no tracing, so the
    receiving unit should not be destroyed.

    Test tracing in.  In this scenario, an infected unit ships animals to a
    neighbouring unit, then the receiving unit (but not the source unit) is
    detected.  Since there is no trace in, only the receiving unit should be
    destroyed.

  <population-file>2units_pigs_cattle_pigs_infected</population-file>

  <parameter-file>trace_in_1</parameter-file>

  <parameter-description>
    For pigs (unit 1), the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness without
    clinical signs lasts 1 day, infectiousness with clinical signs lasts 2
    days, and immunity lasts 3 days.  For cattle (unit 0), the latent period
    lasts 1 day, infectiousness lasts 3 days, clinical signs accompany
    infectiousness immediately, and immunity lasts 3 days.

    The movement rate from pig units to cattle units is fixed at 1 shipment
    each day.  The distance of shipments is fixed at 10 km.  No parameters are
    set for movement from cattle units to pig units.

    Latent units can be the source of an exposure.

    The probability of infection given exposure is 1.

    The probability of detecting diseased cattle vs. the number of days they
    have been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The probability of
    detecting diseased cattle vs. the number of days since a public
    announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.  No parameters are set for
    detecting diseased pigs, so the infection in the pigs herd will not be
    detected.
    
    The authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The
    authorities can destroy an unlimited/very large number of units each day.
    
    The probability of success for a trace-out investigation is 1.
    
    There is no vaccination.

    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
     - On day 1 unit 1 (pigs) will ship to and infect unit 0 (cattle).
     - On day 2 unit 0 will be Latent.
     - On day 3 unit 0 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected and
       slated for destruction.  Trace in will fail to discover the shipment
       from unit 0.
     - On day 4 unit 0 will be destroyed.

  <description>
    Test a scenario where an infected unit ships animals to a neighbouring
    unit, that unit in turn infects another, then the original source unit (but
    not the others) is detected.  Since trace out goes only 1 step forward,
    only the unit that received the first shipment should be found by trace out
    and destroyed.

    For pigs (unit 2), the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness without
    clinical signs lasts 1 day, infectiousness with clinical signs lasts 2
    days, and immunity lasts 3 days.  For cattle (units 0 and 1), the latent
    period lasts 1 day, infectiousness lasts 3 days, clinical signs accompany
    infectiousness immediately, and immunity lasts 3 days.

    The movement rate from pig units to cattle units is fixed at 1 shipment
    each day.  The distance of shipments is fixed at 10 km.  The parameters for
    movement from cattle units to cattle units are the same.

    Latent units can be the source of an exposure.

    The probability of infection given exposure is 1.

    The probability of detecting diseased pigs vs. the number of days they have
    been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The probability of detecting
    diseased pigs vs. the number of days since a public announcement of an
    outbreak is also fixed at 1.  No parameters are set for detecting diseased
    cattle, so the infection in the cattle herd will not be detected.
    
    The authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The
    authorities can destroy an unlimited/very large number of units each day.
    
    The probability of success for a trace-out investigation is 1.
    
    There is no vaccination.

    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
     - On day 1 unit 2 (pigs) will ship to and infect unit 1 (cattle).
     - On day 2 unit 1 will be Latent.  It will ship to and infect unit 0
       (cattle).
     - On day 3 unit 2 (pigs) will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected
       and slated for destruction.  Trace out will discover the shipment from
       unit 2 to unit 1, and unit 1 will will also be slated for destruction.
       Trace out will fail to discover the shipment from unit 1 to unit 0.
     - On day 4 units 1 and 2 will be destroyed.

  <description>
    Test that trace out investigations can be limited to a certain number of
    days back.  In this scenario, an infected unit ships animals to a
    neighbouring unit, then the source unit (but not the receiving unit) is
    detected several days later, inside the time window of interest.  The
    receiving unit should be found by trace out and destroyed.

    This test requires a third unit of a different species, which gets detected
    early and (via movement controls) stops all animal shipments.  This allows
    us to use the probability of detection vs. days that a unit has been
    showing clinical signs to control the delay between the last shipment and
    the trace out investigation.

    For sheep (unit 0), the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness lasts 3
    days, clinical signs accompany infectiousness immediately, and immunity
    lasts 3 days.  For cattle (unit 1), the latent period lasts 1 day,

    The movement rate from pig units to cattle units is fixed at 1 shipment
    each day.  The distance of shipments is fixed at 10 km.  The movement rate
    multiplier is 1 until the public is aware of the outbreak, then it

    The probability of detecting diseased pigs is 0 when they first show

    detecting diseased pigs vs. the number of days since a public announcement
    of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.  Thus, with fixed "random" numbers of
    0.5, diseased pigs will be detected after 2 days (when probability = 2/3).

    No parameters are set for detecting diseased cattle, so the infection in

       no shipments.
     - On day 4 (when unit 2 has been infectious for 2 days) unit 2 (pigs) will
       be detected and slated for destruction.  Trace out will find unit 1
       (cattle), which last received a shipment from unit 2 two days ago, and

  <short-name>trace without destruction 1</short-name>

  <description>
    Test that traced contacts can be quarantined without being destroyed.  In
    this test and the following four, there are three units of different
    production types:

    0-&gt;1&lt;-2

    Units 0 and 2 are infected; the middle unit 1 is not.  Different effects
    can be observed on unit 1 depending on whether unit 0 ships to unit 1, unit
    2 ships to unit 1, or both units 0 and 2 ship to unit 1.  The scenario can
    be further modified by having one of those shipments traced.

    In this scenario, unit 2 does not ship to unit 1, so there is no trace to
    unit 1, no quarantine on unit 1, and no destruction of unit 1.  Unit 0 does
    ship to unit 1 and causes unit 1 to become infected.

    For all production types, the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness
    lasts 3 days, clinical signs accompany infectiousness immediately, and
    natural immunity lasts 5 days.

    The movement rate from sheep units to cattle units is fixed at 1 shipment
    each day.  The distance of shipments is fixed at 10 km.  The movement rate
    multiplier is 0 until the public is aware of the outbreak, then it
    immediately goes to 1.  (This is the opposite of what one might expect from
    movement controls; its purpose here is to make sure any contact we see from
    unit 0 to unit 1 happens after the trace, not before.)

    There are no shipments from pig units to cattle units.

    Latent units can be the source of an exposure.
    
    The probability of infection given exposure is 1.
    
    The probability of detecting diseased pig units vs. the number of days they
    have been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1. The probability of
    detecting diseased pig units vs. the number of days since a public
    announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.  Other production types are
    not detected.

    The authorities require 3 days to set up a destruction program before
    beginning.  The authorities will destroy units that are detected as
    diseased.  The authorities will also destroy trace outs.  The probability
    of success for a trace-out investigation is 1.  The authorities can destroy
    an unlimited/very large number of units each day.

    There is no vaccination.

    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
     - On day 1 units 0 (sheep) and 2 (pigs) will be latent.  There will be no
       shipments from unit 0 because the movement rate multiplier is 0.
     - On day 2 units 0 and 2 will be Infectious Clinical.  Unit 2 (pigs) will
       be detected and marked for destruction.  No trace outs will be found
       from unit 2 because it has made no shipments.
     - On day 3 (1 day after the first detection) the movement rate multiplier
       for sheep-to-cattle movements will be 1.  Unit 0 (sheep) will ship to
       and infect unit 1.  The destruction program will not be ready for 3 more
       days.
     - On day 4 unit 1 will be Latent.  The destruction program will not be
       ready for 2 more days.
     - On day 5 nothing new will happen.  The destruction program will not be
       ready for 1 more day.
     - On day 6 the destruction program will be ready to begin.  Unit 2 will be
       destroyed.

  <description>
    Test that traced contacts can be quarantined without being destroyed.  In
    this test, there are three units of different production types:

    0-&gt;1&lt;-2

    Units 0 and 2 are infected; the middle unit 1 is not.  Different effects
    can be observed on unit 1 depending on whether unit 0 ships to unit 1, unit
    2 ships to unit 1, or both units 0 and 2 ship to unit 1.  The scenario can
    be further modified by having one of those shipments traced.

    In this scenario, unit 2 ships to and infects unit 1, the shipment is
    traced and unit 1 is destroyed.

    to become infected.

  <parameter-description>
    For pigs (unit 2), the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness without
    clinical signs lasts 1 day, infectiousness with clinical signs lasts 1 day,
    and immunity lasts 3 days.  For cattle (units 0 and 1), the latent period
    lasts 1 day, infectiousness lasts 2 days, clinical signs accompany
    infectiousness immediately, and immunity lasts 3 days.

    The movement rate from pig units to cattle units is fixed at 1 shipment
    each day.  The distance of shipments is fixed at 20 km.  No parameters are
    set for movement from cattle units to pigs units or from cattle units to
    cattle units.

    Latent units can be the source of an exposure.

    The probability of infection given exposure is 1.

    The probability of detecting diseased pigs vs. the number of days they have
    been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The probability of detecting
    diseased pigs vs. the number of days since a public announcement of an
    outbreak is also fixed at 1.  No parameters are set for detecting diseased
    cattle, so the infection in the cattle herd will not be detected.

    The authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The
    authorities can destroy 1 unit each day.  The priorities for destruction
    are: detected units = 1, units within 10 km of a detected unit = 2, units
    that have received animals from a detected unit = 3.

    The probability of success for a trace-out investigation is 1.  The period
    of interest for a trace-out investigation is 14 days back.

    There is no vaccination.
    
    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
     - On day 1 unit 2 (pigs) will ship to and infect unit 0 (cattle).
     - On day 2 unit 2 will ship to unit 0.
     - On day 3 unit 2 will be detected.  All 3 units will be marked for
       destruction: unit 2 because of the detection, unit 1 because it is
       within 10 km of unit 2, and unit 0 because of trace out.
     - On day 4 unit 2 will be destroyed because detection has the highest
       priority.
     - On day 5 unit 1 will be destroyed because ring destruction has the
       second-highest priority.
     - On day 6 unit 0 will be destroyed because trace out has the lowest
       priority.

    The parameters are identical to the test "priority detected &gt; nearby

    For pigs (unit 2), the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness without

    The movement rate from pig units to cattle units is fixed at 1 shipment

    cattle, so the infection in the cattle herd will not be detected.

    The authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The
    authorities can destroy 1 unit each day.  The priorities for destruction
    are: detected units = 1, units within 10 km of a detected unit = 2, units

    The probability of success for a trace-out investigation is 1.  The period
    of interest for a trace-out investigation is 14 days back.

    There is no vaccination.
    
    What should happen:
     - On day 1 unit 2 (pigs) will ship to and infect unit 0 (cattle).
     - On day 2 unit 2 will ship to unit 0.
     - On day 3 unit 2 will be detected.  All 3 units will be marked
       for destruction: unit 2 because of the detection, unit 1 because it is
       within 10 km of unit 2, and unit 0 because of trace out.
     - On day 4 unit 2 will be destroyed because detection has the
       highest priority.
     - On day 5 unit 1 will be destroyed because ring destruction has
       the second-highest priority.
     - On day 6 unit 0 will be destroyed because trace out has the

  <parameter-description>
    For cattle (unit 0), the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness lasts 10
    days, clinical signs accompany infectiousness immediately, and immunity
    lasts 5 days. For pigs (unit 2), the latent period is 1 day longer, and for
    sheep (unit 3), the latent period is 2 days longer.

    The probability of detecting diseased units vs. the number of days they
    have been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The probability of
    detecting diseased units vs. the number of days since a public announcement
    of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    The authorities require 2 days to set up a destruction program before
    beginning.  The authorities can destroy 1 unit each day.  The priorities
    for destruction are: production type (cattle &gt; pigs &gt; sheep) &gt;
    reason &gt; time waiting.

    There is no disease spread and no vaccination.
    
    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
     - On day 1 all 3 units will be latent.
     - On day 2 unit 0 (cattle) will be infectious clinical.  It will
       be detected and marked for destruction.
     - On day 3 unit 1 (pigs) will be infectious clinical.  It will
       be detected and marked for destruction.  The destruction program will
       not be ready for 2 more days.
     - On day 4 unit 2 (sheep) will be infectious clinical.  It will
       be detected and marked for destruction.  The destruction program will
       not be ready for 1 more day.
     - On day 5 the destruction program will be ready to begin.  Unit
       0 will be destroyed because it is cattle.
     - On day 6 unit 1 will be destroyed because it is pigs.
     - On day 7 unit 2 will be destroyed because it is sheep.

    Note that the destruction order by production type is the
    &lt;i&gt;same&lt;/i&gt; as it would have been by time waiting.

    lasts 5 days. For pigs (unit 3), the latent period is 1 day longer, and for
    sheep (units 1 and 2), the latent period is 2 days longer.

    The movement rate from pig units to sheep units is fixed at 1 shipment
    each day.  The distance of shipments is fixed at 2 km.  Latent units can be
    the source of an exposure.

    The probability of detecting diseased cattle and pig units vs. the number
    of days they have been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The
    probability of detecting diseased cattle and pig units vs. the number of
    days since a public announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.  No
    parameters are set for detecting diseased sheep.

    The authorities require 2 days to set up a destruction program before
    beginning.  The authorities can destroy 1 unit each day.  Direct contacts
    will be traced and destroyed; the probability of success for a trace-out
    investigation is 1.  Units within 1 km of a detected unit will also be
    destroyed.  The priorities for destruction are: production type (pigs &gt;
    cattle &gt; sheep) &gt; reason (basic &gt; trace &gt; ring) &gt; time
    waiting.

    There is no vaccination.
    
    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
     - On day 1 unit 0 (cattle) and unit 3 (pigs) will be latent.
       Unit 3 will ship to unit 2 (sheep) and infect it.
     - On day 2 unit 0 (cattle) will be infectious clinical.  It will
       be detected and marked for destruction.  Unit 1 (sheep) will also be
       marked for destruction because it is inside a 1 km ring.
     - On day 3 unit 3 (pigs) will be infectious clinical.  It will
       be detected and marked for destruction.  Unit 2 (sheep) will also be
       marked for destruction because it received animals from unit 3.  The
       destruction program will not be ready for 2 more days.
     - On day 4 nothing new will happen.  The destruction program
       will not be ready for 1 more day.
     - On day 5 the destruction program will be ready to begin.  Unit
       3 will be destroyed because it is pigs.
     - On day 6 unit 0 will be destroyed because it is cattle.
     - On day 7 the units remaining to be destroyed (1 and 2) are both
       sheep, so the reason for destruction will be used to prioritize them.
       Unit 2 will be destroyed because trace back has priority over ring
       destruction.
     - On day 8 unit 1 will be destroyed.

    Note that the destruction order is the
    &lt;i&gt;opposite&lt;/i&gt; of what it would have been
    if time waiting had priority over reason for destruction.

  <parameter-description>
    For cattle (unit 0), the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness lasts 10
    days, clinical signs accompany infectiousness immediately, and immunity
    lasts 5 days. For pigs (unit 3), the latent period is 1 day longer, and for
    sheep (units 1 and 2), the latent period is 2 days longer.

    The movement rate from pig units to sheep units is fixed at 1 shipment
    each day.  The distance of shipments is fixed at 2 km.  Latent units can be
    the source of an exposure.

    The probability of detecting diseased cattle and pig units vs. the number
    of days they have been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The
    probability of detecting diseased cattle and pig units vs. the number of
    days since a public announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.  No
    parameters are set for detecting diseased sheep.

    The authorities require 2 days to set up a destruction program before
    beginning.  The authorities can destroy 1 unit each day.  Direct contacts
    will be traced and destroyed; the probability of success for a trace-out
    investigation is 1.  Units within 1 km of a detected unit will also be
    destroyed.  The priorities for destruction are: production type (cattle
    &gt; sheep) &gt; time waiting &gt; reason (basic &gt; trace &gt; ring).
    Pigs are not destroyed.

    There is no vaccination.
    
    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
     - On day 1 unit 0 (cattle) and unit 3 (pigs) will be latent.
       Unit 3 will ship to unit 2 (sheep) and infect it.
     - On day 2 unit 0 (cattle) will be infectious clinical.  It will
       be detected and marked for destruction.  Unit 1 (sheep) will also be
       marked for destruction because it is inside a 1 km ring.
     - On day 3 unit 3 (pigs) will be infectious clinical.  It will
       be detected and marked for destruction.  Unit 2 (sheep) will also be
       marked for destruction because it received animals from unit 3.  The
       destruction program will not be ready for 2 more days.
     - On day 4 nothing new will happen.  The destruction program
       will not be ready for 1 more day.
     - On day 5 the destruction program will be ready to begin.  Unit
       0 will be destroyed because it is cattle.
     - On day 6 the units remaining to be destroyed (1 and 2) are both
       sheep, so time waiting will be used to prioritize them.  Unit 1 will be
       destroyed because it has been waiting since day 2 (unit 2 was marked
       for destruction a day later).
     - On day 7 unit 2 will be destroyed.

    Unit 3 (pigs) is never destroyed.  The simulation ends when unit 3 ceases
    to be infectious.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 unit 0 (cattle) and unit 3 (pigs) will be latent.
       Unit 3 will ship to unit 2 (sheep) and infect it.
     - On day 2 unit 0 (cattle) will be infectious clinical.  It will
       be detected and marked for destruction.  Unit 1 (sheep) will also be
       marked for destruction because it is inside a 1 km ring.
     - On day 3 unit 3 (pigs) will be infectious clinical.  It will
       be detected and marked for destruction.  Unit 2 (sheep) will also be
       marked for destruction because it received animals from unit 3.  The
       destruction program will not be ready for 2 more days.
     - On day 4 nothing new will happen.  The destruction program
       will not be ready for 1 more day.
     - On day 5 the destruction program will be ready to begin.  Unit
       3 will be destroyed because it is pigs.  This is the first destruction
       overall, the first of pigs, and the first due to detection.
     - On day 6 unit 0 will be destroyed because it is cattle.  This is the
       first destruction of cattle.
     - On day 7 the units remaining to be destroyed (1 and 2) are both
       sheep, so the reason for destruction will be used to prioritize them.
       Unit 2 will be destroyed because trace back has priority over ring
       destruction.  This is the first destruction of sheep, and the first due
       to tracing.
     - On day 8 unit 1 will be destroyed.  This is the first destruction due to
       a ring.

  <parameter-description>
    For cattle (unit 0, initially infected), the latent period lasts 1 day,
    infectiousness lasts 10 days, clinical signs accompany infectiousness
    immediately, and immunity lasts 5 days. For pigs (unit 3, initially
    infected), the latent period is 1 day longer.  For sheep and goats (units
    1 and 2), the duration of the disease stages are irrelevant but vaccine
    immunity lasts 5 days.

    The probability of detecting diseased units vs. the number of days they
    have been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The probability of
    detecting diseased units vs. the number of days since a public announcement
    of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    A vaccination program begins at the first detection.  Units within 1 km of
    a detection will be vaccinated.  For the first two days, there is no
    capacity to vaccinate; after that, the authorities can vaccinate 1 herd per
    day.  The priorities for destruction are: production type (sheep &gt;
    goats &gt; cattle &gt; pigs) &gt; reason &gt; time waiting.
    
    The vaccine produces immunity immediately, and the immunity lasts 5 days.

    There is no disease spread and no destruction.
    
    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
     - On day 1 units 0 and 3 will be latent.
     - On day 2 unit 0 (cattle) will be infectious clinical.  It will
       be detected and nearby unit 1 (sheep) will be marked for vaccination.
     - On day 3 unit 3 (pigs) will be infectious clinical.  It will
       be detected and nearby unit 2 (goats) will be marked for vaccination.
     - On day 4 nothing new will happen.
     - On day 5 (3 days after the first detection) the vaccination
       capacity will come on-line.  Unit 1 will be vaccinated because it
       is sheep.
     - On day 6 unit 2 will be vaccinated because it is goats.

    Note that the vaccination order by production type is the
    &lt;i&gt;same&lt;/i&gt; as it would have been by time waiting.

    For both cattle and pigs, the latent period lasts 1 day,  infectiousness
    lasts 2 days, clinical signs accompany infectiousness immediately, and
    natural immunity lasts 3 days.

    The movement rate from cattle units to cattle units is fixed at 1 shipment
    each day.  The distance of shipments is fixed at 1 km.  Latent units can be
    the source of an exposure.  The probability of infection given exposure is
    1.  There are no shipments from cattle units to pig units, pig units to
    cattle units, or pig units to pig units.

    The probability of detecting diseased units vs. the number of days they
    have been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The probability of
    detecting diseased units vs. the number of days since a public announcement
    of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    The authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The
    authorities can destroy an unlimited/very large number of units each day.

    A vaccination program begins at the second detection.  Units within 0.75 km
    of a detection will be vaccinated.  The authorities can vaccinate an
    unlimited/very large number of units each day.  The vaccine produces
    immunity immediately, and the immunity lasts 5 days.
    
    Recapping what should happen as a result of all this:
     - Infection will spread from unit 0 to 1, 1 to 2, and 2 to 3 on
       successive days.  
     - Unit 0 will be detected and marked for destruction on day 2
       (when it goes infectious clinical) and destroyed on day 3.  Similarly,
       unit 1 will be destroyed on day 4, unit 2 on day 5, and unit 3 on day 6.
     - Unit 0 is detected on day 2, but this will not trigger
       vaccinations because the threshold of 2 detections has not been
       reached.  Unit 5 (just above unit 1) will be marked for vaccination on
       the day unit 1 is detected, day 3.  It will be vaccinated on day 4.
       Similarly, unit 6 will be vaccinated on day 5, and unit 7 on day 6.

  <parameter-description>
    This test is almost the same as “vaccination threshold 4 detections, 3rd +
    4th on same day” above.  But in this test, the last unit to be detected
    (unit 3) is detected by a test instead of by clinical signs.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1, infection will spread via direct contact from units 0 and 1 to
       units 2 and 3.
     - On day 2, units 0 and 1 will be detected and marked for destruction.
       Trace outs will be initiated from both units.
       No vaccinations will be requested yet, because only 2 detections have occurred.
     - On day 3, units 0 and 1 will be destroyed (their state will show as
       Destroyed on day 4).
       Unit 2 will be Infectious Clinical;
       it will be detected by clinical signs and marked for destruction.
       Unit 3, which is a different production type,
       will be Infectious Subclinical and will not be detected by clinical signs.
       However, the trace initiated on day 2 will find unit 3,
       and unit 3 will be examined for clinical signs.
       The examination will fail to find clinical signs,
       so a test will be conducted,
       and the test will detect disease.
       Now there have been 4 detections, so vaccination rings will be
       triggered around unit 3 (the 4th unit detected)
       and also around unit 2, detected earlier on the same day.
       Units 6 and 7 will be marked for vaccination.
     - On day 4, units 6 and 7 will be vaccinated (their state will show as
       Vaccine Immune on day 5).

  <description>
    This is one of a set of 3 tests that check whether a vaccination that is
    cancelled due to destruction coming up on the same day still counts against
    vaccination resources (it should not).

    In this scenario, there is no destruction, so we simply see the result of
    having limited vaccination resources.

  <parameter-description>
    The latent period lasts 2 days, infectiousness with clinical signs lasts 1
    day, and natural immunity lasts 1 day.

    The probability of detecting diseased units vs. the number of days they
    have been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The probability of
    detecting diseased units vs. the number of days since a public announcement
    of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    Units detected as diseased will be destroyed.  The authorities require 3
    days to set up a destruction program before beginning.  The destruction
    capacity is zero, so no units will ever actually be destroyed.

    A vaccination program begins at the fourth detection.  Units within 3/4 of
    a km of a detection will be vaccinated.  Detected infected units are
    vaccinated.  The authorities can vaccinate 3 units each day.  Units of
    production type “A” have first priority, so unit 6, the sole unit of
    production type “B”, will always get vaccinated last.  The vaccine produces
    immunity immediately, and the immunity lasts 2 days.

    There is no disease spread.
    
    What should happen:
     - On day 1 units 1, 2, and 3 will be Infectious Clinical (they start out
       that way).  They will be detected and slated for destruction.
     - On day 3 unit 0 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected and
       slated for destruction.  Because it is the 4th detection, it will start
       a vaccination program.  Units 3, 4, 5, and 6 will be slated for
       vaccination.
     - On day 4, units 3, 4, and 5 will be vaccinated.
     - Day 5 would be the first day destruction is possible (days 2, 3, and 4
       were the 3-day setup delay).  But the destruction capacity is zero, so
       no units will be destroyed.  However, three of the vaccinated units will
       be Vaccine Immune on this day, and the remaining one will be vaccinated.

    This is one of a set of 3 tests that check whether a vaccination that is
    cancelled due to destruction coming up on the same day still counts against
    vaccination resources (it should not).

    In this scenario, destruction happens 1 day after vaccination, so it does
    not cancel any vaccinations.

    The parameters are the same as for “destruction vs. vaccination,
    vaccination resources, no destruction” above, but this time the authorities
    can destroy an unlimited/very large number of units each day.
    
    What should happen:
     - On day 1 units 1, 2, and 3 will be Infectious Clinical (they start out
       that way).  They will be detected and slated for destruction.
     - On day 3 unit 0 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected and
       slated for destruction.  Because it is the 4th detection, it will start
       a vaccination program.  Units 3, 4, 5, and 6 will be slated for
       vaccination.
     - On day 4, units 3, 4, and 5 will be vaccinated.
     - On day 5 destruction can begin (days 2, 3, and 4 were the 3-day setup
       delay).  Units 0, 1, 2, and 3 will be destroyed.  Three of the
       vaccinated units will be Vaccine Immune on this day, and the remaining
       one will be vaccinated.

    This is one of a set of 3 tests that check whether a vaccination that is

    In this scenario, destruction happens the same day as vaccination, so it
    should cancel a vaccination.

    The parameters are the same as for “destruction vs. vaccination,
    vaccination resources, destruction 1 day later” above, but this time the
    destruction program can begin 1 day sooner.
    
    What should happen:
     - On day 1 units 1, 2, and 3 will be Infectious Clinical (they start out
       that way).  They will be detected and slated for destruction.
     - On day 3 unit 0 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected and
       slated for destruction.  Because it is the 4th detection, it will start
       a vaccination program.  Units 3, 4, 5, and 6 will be slated for
       vaccination.
     - On day 4 destruction can begin (days 2 and 3 were the 2-day setup delay).
       Units 0, 1, 2, and 3 will be destroyed.  This is also the day that
       vaccinations begin, and since one of the units slated for vaccination is
       being destroyed, the remaining three can all be vaccinated today.
     - On day 5 the three vaccinated units will be Vaccine Immune.

    Test tracing in.  In this scenario, an infected unit ships animals to a
    neighbouring unit, then the receiving unit (but not the source unit) is
    detected.  The source unit should be found by trace in and destroyed.  This
    scenario is like "trace in" above, but because version 3.2 includes trace
    in, this time the trace will work.

  <parameter-description>
    For pigs (unit 1), the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness without
    clinical signs lasts 1 day, infectiousness with clinical signs lasts 2
    days, and immunity lasts 3 days.  For cattle (unit 0), the latent period
    lasts 1 day, infectiousness lasts 3 days, clinical signs accompany
    infectiousness immediately, and immunity lasts 3 days.

    The movement rate from pig units to cattle units is 1 shipment each day.
    The distance of shipments is fixed at 10 km.  No parameters are set for
    movement from cattle units to pig units.

    Latent units can be the source of an exposure.

    The probability of infection given exposure is 1.

    The probability of detecting diseased cattle vs. the number of days they
    have been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The probability of
    detecting diseased cattle vs. the number of days since a public
    announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.  No parameters are set for
    detecting diseased pigs, so the infection in the pigs herd will not be
    detected.
    
    The authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The
    authorities can destroy an unlimited/very large number of units each day.
    
    The probability of success for both trace-in and trace-out investigations
    is 0.505, which will be just sufficient for success with fixed "random"
    numbers of 0.5.
    
    There is no vaccination.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 unit 1 (pigs) will ship to and infect unit 0 (cattle).
     - On day 2 unit 0 will be Latent.
     - On day 3 unit 0 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected and
       slated for destruction.  Trace in will find unit 1, which will also be
       slated for destruction.
     - On day 4 both units will be destroyed.

    This is part of a group of scenarios that check combinations of tracing out

    For all production types, the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness
    with clinical signs lasts 1 day, and immunity lasts 3 days.

    The movement rate is 1 shipment per day, always going from left to right.
    Latent units cannot be the source of an exposure.  The probability of
    infection given exposure is 1.

    The probability of detecting a diseased unit of production type "C" (the
    one in the middle) vs. the number of days it has been showing clinical
    signs is fixed at 1.  No parameters are set for detecting units of other
    production types.
    
    The authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The
    authorities can destroy an unlimited/very large number of units each day.
    
    There is no vaccination.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 the two units of type "A" on the left will be Latent.
     - On day 2 the "A" units will be Infectious Clinical.  They will ship to
       and infect the two "B" units.  Because of the 1-day latent period, the
       infection will keep moving to the right every 2 days.
     - On day 6 the "C" unit will be detected.  It will be slated for
       destruction.
     - On day 7 the "C" unit will be destroyed.  (Its state will show as
       Destroyed on day 8.)

    This is part of a group of scenarios that check combinations of tracing out
    and in.  These scenarios all use a herd file in which infection moves
    across the units from left to right.

    In this scenario, tracing is 0% successful.

  <parameter-description>
    For all production types, the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness
    with clinical signs lasts 1 day, and immunity lasts 3 days.

    The movement rate is 1 shipment per day, always going from left to right.
    Latent units cannot be the source of an exposure.  The probability of
    infection given exposure is 1.

    The probability of detecting a diseased unit of production type "C" (the
    one in the middle) vs. the number of days it has been showing clinical
    signs is fixed at 1.  No parameters are set for detecting units of other
    production types.
    
    The authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The
    authorities can destroy an unlimited/very large number of units each day.

    Both tracing out and tracing in are 0% successful at finding contacts.
    
    There is no vaccination.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 the two units of type "A" on the left will be Latent.
     - On day 2 the "A" units will be Infectious Subclinical.  They will ship
       to and infect the two "B" units.  Because of the 1-day latent period,
       the infection will keep moving to the right every 2 days.
     - On day 6 the "C" unit will be detected.  It will be slated for
       destruction.  A trace out and trace in will be attempted, but will fail
       to find any contacts.
     - On day 7 the "C" unit will be destroyed.  (Its state will show as
       Destroyed on day 8.)

    This is part of a group of scenarios that check combinations of tracing out
    and in.  These scenarios all use a herd file in which infection moves
    across the units from left to right.

    In this scenario, tracing is 0% successful.  We check the reporting
    variables to make sure that "no tracing" vs "0% success at tracing" are
    each reported properly.

    Parameters: see "trace directions, neither direction succeeds" above.

    On day 6, when unit "C" is detected, we should count 2 trace attempts (one
    trace out, one trace in), 4 direct contacts potentially traced, 0 actually
    traced.

    For all production types, the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness
    with clinical signs lasts 1 day, and immunity lasts 3 days.

    The movement rate is 1 shipment per day, always going from left to right.
    Latent units cannot be the source of an exposure.  The probability of
    infection given exposure is 1.

    The probability of detecting a diseased unit of production type "C" (the
    one in the middle) vs. the number of days it has been showing clinical
    signs is fixed at 1.  No parameters are set for detecting units of other
    production types.
    
    The authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The
    authorities can destroy an unlimited/very large number of units each day.

    Tracing direct contacts is 100% successful.
    
    There is no vaccination.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 the two units of type "A" on the left will be Latent.
     - On day 2 the "A" units will be Infectious Subclinical.  They will ship
       to and infect the two "B" units.  Because of the 1-day latent period,
       the infection will keep moving to the right every 2 days.
     - On day 6 the "C" unit will be detected.  It will be slated for
       destruction.  A trace out and trace in will be attempted.  Trace out
       will find the "D" and "E" units.  Trace in will find the "B" units.
       These units will be slated for destruction.
     - On day 7 the five units will be destroyed.  (Their state will show as
       Destroyed on day 8.)

    Parameters: see "trace directions, both directions succeed" above.

    On day 6, when unit "C" is detected, we should count 2 trace attempts (one
    trace out, one trace in), 4 direct contacts potentially traced, 4 actually
    traced.

    For all production types, the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness

    The movement rate is 1 shipment per day, always going from left to right.
    Latent units cannot be the source of an exposure.  The probability of

    The probability of detecting a diseased unit of production type "C" (the

    The authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The
    authorities can destroy an unlimited/very large number of units each day.

    Tracing direct contacts is 100% successful.  Units found by trace out are
    destroyed.  Units found by trace in are treated just like detections, so
    they are destroyed, but they also trigger more traces.  In this way, trace
    in goes as many steps backward as it can.

    There is no vaccination.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 the two units of type "A" on the left will be Latent.
     - On day 2 the "A" units will be Infectious Subclinical.  They will ship
       to and infect the two "B" units.  Because of the 1-day latent period,
       the infection will keep moving to the right every 2 days.
     - On day 6 the "C" unit will be detected.  It will be slated for
       destruction.  A trace out and trace in will be attempted.  Trace out
       will find the "D" and "E" units.  Trace in will find the "B" units and,
       through further traces, the "A" units.  The units found by tracing will
       be slated for destruction.
     - On day 7 the seven units will be destroyed.  (Their state will show as
       Destroyed on day 8.)

  <description>
    This is part of a group of scenarios that check combinations of tracing out
    and in.  These scenarios all use a herd file in which infection moves
    across the units from left to right.

    In this scenario, tracing all contacts is 100% successful.  Trace out goes
    1 step forward, but trace in follows as many steps back as it can.

  <parameter-description>
    For all production types, the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness
    with clinical signs lasts 1 day, and immunity lasts 3 days.

    The movement rate is 1 shipment per day, always going from left to right.
    Latent units cannot be the source of an exposure.  The probability of
    infection given exposure is 1.

    The probability of detecting a diseased unit of production type "F" (the
    one at the far right) vs. the number of days it has been showing clinical
    signs is fixed at 1.  No parameters are set for detecting units of other
    production types.
    
    The authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The
    authorities can destroy an unlimited/very large number of units each day.

    Tracing direct contacts is 100% successful.  Units found by trace out are
    destroyed.  Units found by trace in are treated just like detections, so
    they are destroyed, but they also trigger more traces.  In this way, trace
    in goes as many steps backward as it can.

    There is no vaccination.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 the two units of type "A" on the left will be Latent.
     - On day 2 the "A" units will be Infectious Subclinical.  They will ship
       to and infect the two "B" units.  Because of the 1-day latent period,
       the infection will keep moving to the right every 2 days.
     - On day 10 the "F" unit will be detected.  It will be slated for
       destruction.  A trace out and trace in will be attempted.  Trace out
       will find nothing, because the "F" unit has not shipped to anyone.
       Trace in will trace all the way back to the "A" units.  The only unit
       that will &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; be slated for destruction is "G",
       because the trace out from "C" only goes one step forward.  (Remember
       that trace ins are treated like detections, so when "C" is found by
       trace in, that will trigger a trace &lt;i&gt;out&lt;/i&gt; from it.)
     - On day 11 the eight units will be destroyed.  (Their state will show as
       Destroyed on day 12.)

  <short-name>trace success depends on source of trace 1</short-name>

  <description>
    This is one of a group of scenarios to test that tracing success depends on
    the type of unit at which the trace originates.  Each scenario has two
    units, 0 and 1 (of different production types), a single contact from 0 to
    1, and tracing both in and out.  Whether the trace finds the other end of
    the contact should depend on the trace success settings for the unit at
    which the trace originates.

    In this scenario, trace success is high for unit 0, low for unit 1.  Unit 0
    is detected, so trace out should succeed and unit 1 should be destroyed.

    This is one of a group of scenarios to test delays in getting trace
    results.  In this scenario, there is a 2-day delay to find the recipient
    unit.

    Note that in this test, on the day the trace results are ready, the unit
    where the trace originated is already Destroyed.  This does not affect the
    trace at all.  The process of tracing with delays can be visualized as:
    you take away the box of records on the day the trace is requested, but it
    takes a certain number of days to go through it.

  <parameter-description>
    For cattle, the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness lasts 1 day,
    clinical signs accompany infectiousness immediately, and immunity lasts 3
    days.  For pigs, the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness without
    clinical signs lasts 1 day, infectiousness with clinical signs lasts 1 day,
    and immunity lasts 3 days.

    The movement rate from pig units to cattle units is fixed at 1 shipment per
    day.  The distance of shipments is fixed at 10 km.  There is no movement in
    the other direction.

    Only pig units are detected.  The probability of detection vs. the number
    of days a unit has been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The
    probability of detection vs. the number of days since a public announcement
    of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    The authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The
    authorities can destroy an unlimited/very large number of units each day.

    The authorities do trace out only.  The probability of success for a
    trace-out investigation is 1, and there is a 2-day delay for getting trace
    results.  Units found by trace are destroyed.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 the pig unit (unit 1) will be Latent.
     - On day 2 unit 1 will be Infectious Subclinical.  It will ship to and
       infect unit 0.
     - On day 3 unit 1 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected and
       marked for destruction.  A trace out will be requested from unit 1.
     - On day 4 unit 1 will be destroyed.  (Its state will appear as Destroyed
       on day 5.)
     - On day 5 the trace requested on day 3 will find unit 0, so unit 0 will
       be marked for destruction.
     - On day 6 unit 0 will be destroyed.  Its state will appear as Destroyed
       on day 7.

  <parameter-description>
    For both production types, the latent period lasts 1 day, the infectious
    clinical period lasts 4 days, and immunity lasts 4 days.

    The movement rate from pig units to cattle units is fixed at 1 shipment
    each day.  There is no movement in the other direction.  Latent units
    cannot be the source of an infection.

    For unit 1 (a pig unit), the probability of detection is 0 on the first and
    second days showing clinical signs, and 1 on following days.  In this set
    of scenarios, this parameter is used to control when trace is initiated.

    For unit 0 (a cattle unit), the probability of detection is 1/3, which is
    always too low for detection when using fixed "random" numbers of 0.5.
    This parameter is set this way so that any detection we see will be the
    result of an exam as part of the trace investigation, not from "regular"
    detection.

    When a unit is detected, trace out will be initiated.  The probability of
    success for a trace investigation is 1, and there is a 2-day delay for
    finding recipient units.  Units found by trace are quarantined, visually
    examined (like regular detection, but with 2x the probability of
    detection) and tested for disease.  The test sensitivity and specificity
    are both 1.

    The authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The
    authorities can destroy an unlimited/very large number of units each day.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 unit 1 will be Latent.
     - On day 2 unit 1 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will ship to and
       infect unit 0.
     - On day 4 unit 0 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will not be detected,
       because the base probability of detection is too low.  However, unit 1
       will be detected on this day.  It will be slated for destruction and a
       trace out will be initiated.
     - On day 5 unit 1 will be destroyed (its state will show as destroyed on
       day 6).
     - On day 6 unit 0 will be found by tracing (2 days after the trace was
       initiated).  A visual inspection by experts, with its increased
       probability of detection, will show that unit 0 is diseased.  Unit 0
       will be slated for destruction.
     - On day 7 unit 0 will be destroyed.  Its state will show as destroyed on
       day 8.

    This is one of a set of tests covering the examples in the new tracing

    spread from a third farm) while the test results are pending.

  <parameter-description>
    For units 1 and 2 (the units involved in shipping), the latent period lasts
    1 day, the infectious clinical period lasts 3 days, and immunity lasts 3
    days.  For unit 0 (the unit that brings in airborne spread later in the
    scenario), the latent period lasts 5 days, the infectious clinical period
    lasts 3 days, and immunity lasts 3 days.

    The movement rate from pig units to cattle units is fixed at 1 shipment
    each day.  There is no movement in the other direction.  Latent units
    cannot be the source of an infection.

    The probability of airborne spread from sheep units to cattle units is
    0.9595 at 1 km, and drops to 0 at 20 km.  This parameter gives a 0.505
    probability of infection at 10 km, just sufficient for the sheep unit (unit
    2) to infect the cattle unit (unit 1).

    For unit 2 (a pig unit), the probability of detection is 0 on the first day
    showing clinical signs, and 1 on following days.  In this set of scenarios,
    this parameter is used to control when trace is initiated.
    
    For unit 1 (a cattle unit), the probability of detection is 1/3, which is
    always too low for detection when using fixed "random" numbers of 0.5.
    This parameter is set this way so that any detection we see will be the
    result of an exam as part of the trace investigation, not from "regular"
    detection.
    
    There is no detection of sheep units.

    When a unit is detected, trace out will be initiated.  The probability of
    success for a trace investigation is 1, and there is a 2-day delay for

  <description>
    This is one of a set of tests covering the examples in the new tracing
    RFC.  In this scenario, unit 2 ships to unit 1.  Unit 2 gets detected.
    Unit 1 is latent when trace out from unit 2 is initiated, latent when it is
    found and tested, but gets destroyed (due to being in a destruction ring
    around a third farm) while the test results are pending.

  <parameter-description>
    For unit 2 (the unit that ships), the latent period lasts 1 day, the
    infectious clinical period lasts 4 days, and immunity lasts 4 days.  For
    unit 1 (the unit that receives the shipment), the latent period lasts 1
    day, the infectious subclinical period lasts 4 days, the infectious
    clinical period lasts 1 day, and immunity lasts 4 days.  For unit 0 (the
    unit that causes the destruction ring later in the scenario), the latent
    period lasts 5 days, the infectious clinical period lasts 4 days, and
    immunity lasts 4 days.

    The movement rate from pig units to cattle units is fixed at 1 shipment
    each day.  There is no movement in the other direction.  Latent units
    cannot be the source of an infection.

    For unit 2 (a pig unit), the probability of detection is 0 on the first day
    showing clinical signs, and 1 on following days.  In this set of scenarios,
    this parameter is used to control when trace is initiated.
    
    For unit 1 (a cattle unit), the probability of detection is 1/3, which is
    always too low for detection when using fixed "random" numbers of 0.5.
    This parameter is set this way so that any detection we see will be the
    result of an exam as part of the trace investigation, not from "regular"
    detection.
    
    There is no detection of sheep units.

    When a unit is detected, trace out will be initiated.  The probability of
    success for a trace investigation is 1, and there is a 2-day delay for
    finding recipient units.  Units found by trace are quarantined, visually
    examined (like regular detection, but with 2x the probability of
    detection) and tested for disease.  Test results take 3 days.  The test
    sensitivity and specificity are both 1.

    The authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The
    authorities can destroy an unlimited/very large number of units each day.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 units 0 and 2 will be Latent.
     - On day 2 unit 2 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will ship to and infect
       unit 1.
     - On day 3 unit 2 will be detected.  It will be slated for destruction and
       a trace out will be initiated.
     - On day 4 unit 2 will be destroyed (its state will show as destroyed on
       day 5).
     - On day 5 unit 1 will be found by tracing (2 days after the trace was
       initiated).  A visual inspection by experts has a high enough
       probability to detect signs of disease, but because the unit is still
       subclinical, there will be no signs.  Samples will be taken for testing.
     - On day 6, unit 0 will be Infectious Clinical, and will be detected.
       Unit 0 and all other units within 12 km will be slated for destruction.
     - On day 7 units 0 and 1 will be destroyed (their state will show as
       destroyed on day 8).
     - On day 8 the test results for unit 1 will be available and will show
       that unit 1 was diseased at the time the test samples were taken.  Unit
       1 will be considered "detected", even though it has already been
       destroyed.  See the following test, which watches the 
       output variable, for confirmation of this.

    Parameters: see "trace RFC example 6" above.

    The number of units detected should be 1 on day 3, when unit 2 is detected,
    1 on day 6, when unit 0 is detected, and 1 on day 8, when the destroyed
    unit is detected (this "detection" happens because test results, based on
    samples taken before the unit was destroyed, become available).
    
    With each detection, a trace out is initiated.  The 2 contacts from unit 2
    to unit 1 (one contact each on days 2 and 3) will show as traced on day 5
    (the day the trace results become available, 2 days after the trace was
    initiated on day 3).  Units 0 and 1 are detected on days 6 and 8,
    respectively, but since they had no outgoing contacts, there are no
    potential recipient farms to trace.

    There should be 2 units detected on day 3.  Note that in "trace RFC example
    6" above, we attempted a trace out from a Destroyed unit (unit 1).  That
    was because we took test samples from the unit before it was destroyed, and
    discovered later that the unit had been diseased.  Therefore, it was worth
    tracing who had had contact with that unit.  In this example, the unit is
    destroyed before we could take test samples, so no further traces can be
    triggered.

    For unit C, the unit where the trace will originate, the latent period
    lasts 1 day, the infectious subclinical period lasts 2 days, the infectious
    clinical period lasts 5 days, and the immune period lasts 7 days.  For
    other production types, the latent period lasts 1 day, the infectious
    clinical period lasts 7 days, and immunity lasts 7 days.

    The contact rates are set up as follows (see also diagram below):
     - 1 direct contact per day from A units to C units
     - 1 indirect contact per day from B units to C units
     - 1 direct contact per day from C units to D units (distance 10 km)
     - 1 indirect contact per day from C units to D units (distance 12 km)

    Units of type C are detected on the first day showing clinical signs.  In
    this scenario, this parameter is used to control when trace is initiated.

    For other production types, the probability of detection is 1/3, which is
    always too low for detection when using fixed "random" numbers of 0.5.
    This parameter is set this way so that any detection we see will be the
    result of an exam as part of the trace investigation, not from "regular"
    detection.

    When a unit is detected, direct and indirect contacts into and out of the
    unit will be traced.  The probability of success for all trace
    investigations is 1, and there is no delay for the trace investigations.
    Units found by trace are quarantined and visually examined.
    When a unit was found by tracing &lt;i&gt;in&lt;/i&gt; a &lt;i&gt;direct&lt;/i&gt;
    contact, the probability of detecting disease during the visual inspection
    is 2x the regular probability of detection.  When a unit was found by any
    other kind of trace, the probability of detection is the same as regular
    detection.

    The authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The
    authorities can destroy an unlimited/very large number of units each day.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 units A and B will be Latent.
     - On day 2 units A and B will be Infectious Clinical.  There will be a
       direct contact from unit A to unit C and an indirect contact from unit
       B to unit C.  Unit C will be infected.
     - On day 3 unit C will be Latent.
     - On day 4 unit C will be Infectious Subclinical.  There will be a direct
       contact from unit C to unit D1 (10 km away) and an indirect contact from
       unit C to unit D2 (12 km away).
     - On day 6 unit C will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected and
       slated for destruction.  A trace investigation will be initiated from
       unit C.  Tracing will discover the contacts with units A, B, D1, and D2.
       Those 4 units will be visually examined.  However, only the
       unit found by trace &lt;i&gt;in&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;direct&lt;/i&gt;
       contacts will be detected as diseased (the detection multipliers for the
       other kinds of traces are too low).  Unit A will be slated for
       destruction.
     - On day 7 units C and A will be destroyed.  Their state will show as
       destroyed on day 8.

    A unit that is found by a trace investigation may be visually examined for
    signs of disease.  This is one of a set of tests that check that the
    probability of detection in this situation can be set by what kind of trace
    (direct or indirect, in or out) found the unit.

  <parameter-description>
    For unit C, the unit where the trace will originate, the latent period
    lasts 1 day, the infectious subclinical period lasts 2 days, the infectious
    clinical period lasts 5 days, and the immune period lasts 7 days.  For
    other production types, the latent period lasts 1 day, the infectious
    clinical period lasts 7 days, and immunity lasts 7 days.

    The contact rates are set up as follows (see also diagram below):
     - 1 direct contact per day from A units to C units
     - 1 indirect contact per day from B units to C units
     - 1 direct contact per day from C units to D units (distance 10 km)
     - 1 indirect contact per day from C units to D units (distance 12 km)

    Units of type C are detected on the first day showing clinical signs.  In
    this scenario, this parameter is used to control when trace is initiated.

    For other production types, the probability of detection is 1/3, which is
    always too low for detection when using fixed "random" numbers of 0.5.
    This parameter is set this way so that any detection we see will be the
    result of an exam as part of the trace investigation, not from "regular"
    detection.

    When a unit is detected, direct and indirect contacts into and out of the
    unit will be traced.  The probability of success for all trace
    investigations is 1, and there is no delay for the trace investigations.
    Units found by trace are quarantined and visually examined.
    When a unit was found by tracing &lt;i&gt;out&lt;/i&gt; a &lt;i&gt;direct&lt;/i&gt;
    contact, the probability of detecting disease during the visual inspection
    is 2x the regular probability of detection.  When a unit was found by any
    other kind of trace, the probability of detection is the same as regular
    detection.

    The authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The
    authorities can destroy an unlimited/very large number of units each day.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 units A and B will be Latent.
     - On day 2 units A and B will be Infectious Clinical.  There will be a
       direct contact from unit A to unit C and an indirect contact from unit
       B to unit C.  Unit C will be infected.
     - On day 3 unit C will be Latent.
     - On day 4 unit C will be Infectious Subclinical.  There will be a direct
       contact from unit C to unit D1 (10 km away) and an indirect contact from
       unit C to unit D2 (12 km away).
     - On day 6 unit C will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected and
       slated for destruction.  A trace investigation will be initiated from
       unit C.  Tracing will discover the contacts with units A, B, D1, and D2.
       Those 4 units will be visually examined.  However, only the
       unit found by trace &lt;i&gt;out&lt;/i&gt; of &lt;i&gt;direct&lt;/i&gt;
       contacts will be detected as diseased (the detection multipliers for the
       other kinds of traces are too low).  Unit D1 will be slated for
       destruction.
     - On day 7 units C and D1 will be destroyed.  Their state will show as
       destroyed on day 8.

    For unit C, the unit where the trace will originate, the latent period
    lasts 1 day, the infectious subclinical period lasts 2 days, the infectious
    clinical period lasts 5 days, and the immune period lasts 7 days.  For
    other production types, the latent period lasts 1 day, the infectious
    clinical period lasts 7 days, and immunity lasts 7 days.

    The contact rates are set up as follows (see also diagram below):
     - 1 direct contact per day from A units to C units
     - 1 indirect contact per day from B units to C units
     - 1 direct contact per day from C units to D units (distance 10 km)
     - 1 indirect contact per day from C units to D units (distance 12 km)

    Units of type C are detected on the first day showing clinical signs.  In
    this scenario, this parameter is used to control when trace is initiated.

    For other production types, the probability of detection is 1/3, which is
    always too low for detection when using fixed "random" numbers of 0.5.
    This parameter is set this way so that any detection we see will be the
    result of an exam as part of the trace investigation, not from "regular"
    detection.

    When a unit is detected, direct and indirect contacts into and out of the
    unit will be traced.  The probability of success for all trace
    investigations is 1, and there is no delay for the trace investigations.
    Units found by trace are quarantined and visually examined.
    When a unit was found by tracing &lt;i&gt;in&lt;/i&gt; a contact, the
    probability of detecting disease during the visual inspection is 2x the
    regular probability of detection.  When a unit was found by any other kind
    of trace, the probability of detection is the same as regular detection.

    The authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The
    authorities can destroy an unlimited/very large number of units each day.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 units A and B will be Latent.
     - On day 2 units A and B will be Infectious Clinical.  There will be a
       direct contact from unit A to unit C and an indirect contact from unit
       B to unit C.  Unit C will be infected.
     - On day 3 unit C will be Latent.
     - On day 4 unit C will be Infectious Subclinical.  There will be a direct
       contact from unit C to unit D1 (10 km away) and an indirect contact from
       unit C to unit D2 (12 km away).
     - On day 6 unit C will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected and
       slated for destruction.  A trace investigation will be initiated from
       unit C.  Tracing will discover the contacts with units A, B, D1, and D2.
       Those 4 units will be visually examined.  However, only the
       units found by trace &lt;i&gt;in&lt;/i&gt; will be detected as diseased
       (the detection multipliers for the other kinds of traces are too low).
       Units A and B will be slated for destruction.
     - On day 7 units C, A, and B will be destroyed.  Their state will show as
       destroyed on day 8.

  <description>
    When a contact occurs from a source unit to a recipient unit, it is
    possible to later trace that contact by a trace-out initiated at the source
    unit or by a trace-in initiated at the recipient unit.  If both types of
    traces are initiated, then it should be 50/50 which type of trace is
    recorded as having discovered the contact.
    
    This test case is based on the example given in issue #2233.

  <parameter-description>
    The latent period lasts 1 day, the infectious clinical period lasts 3 days,
    and immunity lasts 3 days.

    The rate of direct contacts from cattle units to pig units is fixed at 1
    per day.  There are no contacts in the opposite direction.
    
    The probability of detecting diseased units vs. the number of days they
    have been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The probability of
    reporting disease is also fixed at 1.

    When a diseased unit is detected, tracing in and out is requested.  The
    probability of trace success is 100%.  Units discovered by trace will be
    pre-emptively destroyed.

    The authorities prioritize pre-emptive destruction of traced units ahead of
    stamping-out (destruction of detected diseased units).
    
    What should happen:
     - On day 1 units 0 and 1 will both be latent  Unit 0 will ship to unit 1.
     - On day 2 units 0 and 2 will both be infectious clinical.  Unit 0 will
       again ship to unit 1.\n\n
       Both units will be detected on this day.  Half the time, the contact
       from unit 0 to unit 1 will be discovered by trace-out, and half the time
       by trace-in.
     - On day 3 both units will be destroyed.  The output variable desnU will
       indicate how the units were flagged for destruction.  The test is
       deliberately stopped at day 3.

    This is one of a set of tests to exercise the vaccination priority system
    after the changes in version 3.3. Units are arranged as shown in the
    diagram below. In this test, the “G” unit triggers vaccination.
    Vaccination is prioritized by production type, in alphabetical order, and
    there is sufficient capacity to vaccinate one “wedge” of units per day.
    Vaccination should proceed clockwise around the ring in groups of 4.

    Units of type “G” are latent for 1 day, clinical for 1 day, then immune.
    Units of type “H” are latent for 1 day, then go straight to immune.

    There is no disease spread.

    Diseased units are detected on the first day showing clinical signs.

    Vaccination is initiated after detection of 1 diseased unit.  There is
    capacity to vaccinate 4 units per day.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 units G and H will be Latent.
     - On day 2 unit G will be Infectious Clinical. It will be detected and a
       vaccination program will be initiated. Unit H goes directly to immune so
       that it will not be involved in this simulation.
     - On day 3 the 4 “A” units will be vaccinated. (Their state will show as
       Vaccine Immune on day 4).
     - On day 4 the 4 “B” units will be vaccinated.
     - On day 5 the 4 “C” units will be vaccinated.
     - On day 6 the 4 “D” units will be vaccinated.
     - On day 7 the 4 “E” units will be vaccinated.
     - On day 8 the 4 “F” units will be vaccinated.
     - On day 9, nothing new happens: all of the units that need to be
       vaccinated have been vaccinated.  This will be the last simulation day.

    This is one of a set of tests to exercise the vaccination priority system
    after the changes in version 3.3. Units are arranged as shown in the
    diagram below. In this test, the “G” unit triggers vaccination.
    Vaccination is prioritized by production type, in alphabetical order, then
    by size, largest to smallest, and there is sufficient capacity to
    vaccinate 2 units per day. Vaccination should proceed clockwise around the
    ring in groups of 2.

    Units of type “G” are latent for 2 days, clinical for 1 day, then immune.
    Units of type “H” are latent for 1 day, clinical for 1 day, then immune.

    There is no disease spread.

    Diseased units are detected on the first day showing clinical signs.

    Vaccination is initiated after detection of 1 diseased unit.  The
    vaccination ring created around a detected “H” unit is larger than the ring
    created around a detected “G” units, as shown in the diagram.  There is
    capacity to vaccinate 4 units per day starting on day 4 of the simulation,
    then it rises to 6 units per day starting on day 7 of the simulation.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 units G and H will be Latent.
     - On day 2 unit H will be Infectious Clinical. It will be detected and a
       vaccination program will be initiated. The north half of the population
       will be queued for vaccination, as shown in the diagram.
     - On day 3, there is no capacity to vaccinate yet. Unit G will be
       Infectious Clinical. It will be detected. The rest of the population
       will be queued for vaccination.
     - On day 4, vaccination capacity comes on-line with capacity to vaccinate
       4 units.  The northern half of the population has been waiting the
       longest.  Within that half, we prioritize by production type in
       alphabetical order, so the “A” units will be vaccinated. (Their state
       will show as Vaccine Immune on day 5.)
     - On day 5, the northern 2 “B” units and the northern 2 “E” units will be
       vaccinated.
     - On day 6, the “F” units will be vaccinated.
     - On day 7, the northern half of the population, which had the oldest
       vaccination requests, has all been vaccinated, so we move on to the
       southern half of the population. There is capacity to vaccinate 6 units,
       so going by production type, the remaining “B” units and all of the “C”
       units will be vaccinated.
     - On day 8, the “D” units and the remaining “E” units will be vaccinated.
     - On day 9, nothing new happens: all of the units that need to be

    Units of type “A” and “F” are latent for 1 day, clinical for 1 day, then
    immune.

    There is no disease spread.

    Diseased units are detected on the first day showing clinical signs.

    Vaccination is initiated after detection of 1 diseased unit.  The
    vaccination ring created around a detected “A” unit is the same size as the
    ring created around a detected “F” unit, as shown in the diagram.  There is
    capacity to vaccinate 2 units per day starting on day 3 of the simulation.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 units A and F will be Latent.
     - On day 2 units A and F will be Infectious Clinical. They will be
       detected and a vaccination program will be initiated. Units B-E and
       G-K will be queued for vaccination, as shown in the diagram.
     - On day 3, there is capacity to vaccinate 2 units. Units E and K are at
       the outside of the rings, so they will be vaccinated. (Their state will
       show as Vaccine Immune on day 5.)
     - On days 4-6, 2 units will be vaccinated each day, moving inward into the
       rings.
     - On day 7, nothing new happens: all of the units that need to be
       vaccinated have been vaccinated.  This will be the last simulation day.

    This is one of a set of tests to exercise the vaccination priority system
    after the changes in version 3.3. Units are arranged as shown in the
    diagram below. In this test, the “A” and “F” units both trigger vaccination
    rings 5km in radius.  Vaccination is prioritized by inside-out order.

    Units of type “A” and “F” are latent for 1 day, clinical for 1 day, then
    immune.

    There is no disease spread.

    Diseased units are detected on the first day showing clinical signs.

    Vaccination is initiated after detection of 1 diseased unit.  The
    vaccination ring created around a detected “A” unit is the same size as the
    ring created around a detected “F” unit, as shown in the diagram.  There is
    capacity to vaccinate 2 units per day starting on day 3 of the simulation.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 units A and F will be Latent.
     - On day 2 units A and F will be Infectious Clinical. They will be
       detected and a vaccination program will be initiated. Units B-E and
       G-K will be queued for vaccination, as shown in the diagram.
     - On day 3, there is capacity to vaccinate 2 units. Units B and G are at
       the inside of the rings, so they will be vaccinated. (Their state will
       show as Vaccine Immune on day 5.)
     - On days 4-6, 2 units will be vaccinated each day, moving outward toward
       the edge of the rings.
     - On day 7, nothing new happens: all of the units that need to be
       vaccinated have been vaccinated.  This will be the last simulation day.

  <description>
    This is one of a set of tests to exercise the vaccination priority system
    after the changes in version 3.3. Units are arranged as shown in the
    diagram below. In this test, the “A” unit triggers vaccination and the
    ring around it is partially completed, going in outside-in order. Then the
    “F” unit triggers vaccination.  Whether the ring around the “A” unit
    “waits” while the other ring “catches up” to the same thickness will depend
    on whether the round-robin option is turned on or not.

  <parameter-description>
    Units of type “A” are latent for 1 day, clinical for 1 day, then immune.
    Units of type “F” are latent for 3 days, clinical for 1 day, then immune.

    There is no disease spread.

    Diseased units are detected on the first day showing clinical signs.

    Vaccination is initiated after detection of 1 diseased unit.  A
    vaccination ring with inner radius 2 km and outer radius 5 km is created
    around a detected “A” unit. A vaccination ring with inner radius 1 km and
    outer radius 3 km is created around a detected “F” unit.  There is capacity
    to vaccinate 1 unit per day.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 units A and F will be Latent.
     - On day 2 unit A will be Infectious Clinical. It will be detected and a
       vaccination program will be initiated. Units C-E will be queued for
       vaccination, as shown in the diagram.
     - On day 3, there is capacity to vaccinate 1 unit. Unit E is at the
       outside of its ring, so it will be vaccinated. (Its state will show as
       Vaccine Immune on day 4.)
     - On day 4, moving inward into the ring, unit D will be vaccinated. Also
       on this day, unit F will be Infectious Clinical. It will be detected and
       units G-H will be queued for vaccination.
     - On day 5, there will be a choice between vaccinating unit C, G, or H.
       The priority is based on round-robin first, then outside-in order. Since
       the ring around unit A had the last turn, unit H, at the outer edge of
       the ring around unit F, will be vaccinated.
     - On day 6, the ring around unit A will get priority, and unit C will be
       vaccinated.
     - On day 7, the remaining unit, G, will be vaccinated.
     - On day 8, nothing new happens: all of the units that need to be
       vaccinated have been vaccinated.  This will be the last simulation day.

    Diseased units of production type “A” are latent for 1 day, clinical for 1
    day, then immune.

    There is no disease spread.

    Diseased units are detected on the first day showing clinical signs.

    Vaccination is initiated after detection of 1 diseased unit.  A suppressive
    vaccination ring of radius 3 1/3 km and a protective vaccination ring with
    inner radius 4.5 km and outer radius 6.5 km is created around a detected
    unit of production type “A”.
    
    There is capacity to vaccinate 2 units per day. Vaccination is prioritized
    by size (largest first).

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 unit 7 will be Latent.
     - On day 2 unit 7 will be Infectious Clinical. It will be detected, a
       vaccination program will be initiated, and suppressive and protective
       vaccination rings will be set up as shown in the diagram below.
     - On day 3 and each following day, there is capacity to vaccinate 2 units.
       Vaccination order will go from left (where the largest units are) to
       right (where the smallest units are). So on day 3 units 1 and 2 will be
       vaccinated. (Their states will show as Vaccine Immune on day 4.)
     - On day 4 units 4 and 5 will be vaccinated.
     - On day 5 units 6 and 8 will be vaccinated.
     - On day 6 units 9 and 10 will be vaccinated.
     - On day 7 units 12 and 13 will be vaccinated.
     - On day 8, there is nothing new to do.  This will be the last simulation
       day.

    In this test, there are two protective rings, one large and one small. They
    do not overlap, but the outermost units in the large ring are closer to the
    center of the small ring than to the center of the large ring. The
    round-robin priority should not group the outer units of the large ring
    together with the small ring.

    Diseased units are detected on the first day showing clinical signs.

    Vaccination is initiated after detection of 1 diseased unit.  A suppressive
    vaccination circle with radius 1 km is created around a detected “A” unit.
    A suppressive vaccination circle with radius 0.5 km is created around a

    There is capacity to vaccinate 2 units on the first day of the vaccination
    program, then 4 units on the second day, then 4 units on each day after

     - On day 3, there is capacity to vaccinate 2 units. By round-robin order, 1
       unit from the left circle and 1 from the right circle will be
       vaccinated. So the largest unit from each circle (1 and 7) will be
       vaccinated. (Their state will show as Vaccine Immune on day 4.)
     - On day 4, there is capacity to vaccinate 4 units. Taking the 2 next

     - On day 6, there is capacity to vaccinate 4 units. The remaining units
       (4 and 10) will be vaccinated.
     - On day 7, there is nothing new to do.  This will be the last simulation
