        <p class="help-block">Here you define how disease spreads from each production type to every other production type.  There are three
        types of spread:
            <ol class="help-block">
                <li class="help-block">Direct contact where two units coming in physical contact with one another. </li>
                <li class="help-block">Indirect contact where units share objects, vehicles, or people in common. </li>
                <li class="help-block">Airborne Spread where the disease itself can be carried in the air. Airborne spread can also be used for local area spread. </li>
