
##Overview

The Animal Disease Spread Model (ADSM) is a software application that simulates the spread of highly contagious animal diseases in a susceptible population. Applied control measures can influence the disease outbreak. ADSM features upgraded technology and a redesigned user interface combined with the trusted logic of NAADSM.

## Applications

•	Evaluate proposed disease control strategies for planning and policy decisions.

•	Provide “what if” scenarios for outbreak planning exercises.

•	Estimate consequences as part of the risk analysis process.

•	Assess the potential economic impacts of disease and associated control measures.

•	Provide input for emergency preparedness and surveillance plans and activities.

•	Create simple scenarios for an educational setting or complex scenarios for policy research.

•	Communicate principles of epidemiology and disease control.

•	Support researchers who incorporate disease modeling in their work.

•	Explore questions related to resources needed in the event of an outbreak.

•	Offer outreach and training in the use of disease models in general, and of ADSM in particular, to scientific and veterinary communities.


## Key Characteristics

•	ADSM is herd based. Disease manifestation and transmission are represented at the level of a herd/flock of animals, rather than at the individual animal level.

•	ADSM is a state transition model. Each infected herd transitions from a susceptible state to and infected state and back to an immune state.

•	ADSM is a stochastic simulation. It mimics the random processes responsible for disease spread. Each simulated outbreak is the result of a unique series of random events and processes. When analyzed together, many simulated outbreaks represent a range of possible outcomes, given a set of shared assumption. 

•	ADSM simulates spatial and temporal aspects of disease spread. Each herd in a scenario is assigned a physical location and disease progression occurs in daily time steps.
