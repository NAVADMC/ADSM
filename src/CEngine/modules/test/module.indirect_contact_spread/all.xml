    Test choice of units by distance.  Choose a contact distance less than the

    NB: This test case does not care about secondary spread, so we end the test

    For cattle, the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness lasts 2 days,

    days.  For pigs, the latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness without
    clinical signs lasts 1 day, infectiousness with clinical signs lasts 1 day,
    and immunity lasts 3 days.

    The contact rate from cattle units to pig units is fixed at 1 contact
    each day.  The distance of contacts is fixed at 10 km.  The parameters for
    movement from cattle units to cattle units are the same.

    The probability of infection given exposure is 1.

    The probability of infection given exposure is 1.

    The probability of detection vs. the number of days a pig unit has been
    showing clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The probability of detection vs. the
    number of days since a public announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at
    1.  No parameters are set for detection of cattle units.
    
    The authorities require 5 days to set up a destruction program before
