  <description>
    Test a scenario where the disease is spreading.  Use airborne spread with
    infection certain at 1 km but prevent spread farther than 1 km.

    In this first test there is no destruction, to confirm that spread acts as
    we expect.  The disease should spread every second day because of the 1 day
    latent period.  It should spread outward in a ring; the immunity period
    should prevent spread back inward.  So:
    
    units 2, 5, 7, and 10 should become infected on day 2

    units 1, 3, 4, 9, 11, and 14 should become infected on day 4
    
    units 0, 8, 13, and 16 should become infected on day 6

    unit 12 should become infected on day 8

    The first wave of infections (units 2, 5, 7, and 10) will be latent (not

    Run again, but with a 2 day delay for setting up a destruction program.
    The delay will allow the first wave cases (units 2, 5, 7, and 10) to become
    infectious for a day and start a second wave.

    The latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness lasts 3 days, clinical signs

    The probability of airborne spread at 1 km is 0.505, and the maximum
    distance of airborne spread is 25 km.
    
    The probability of detection vs. the number of days a unit has been showing
    clinical signs is fixed at 1.  The probability of detection vs. the number
    of days since a public announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.
    
    The authorities require 2 days to set up a destruction program before

    Units 0 and 2 are infected; the middle unit 1 is not.  Unit 0 will try to
    ship to unit 1.  Whether the shipment (and infection) happens will depend

    detected and a destruction ring is drawn around unit 2.

    In this baseline scenario, unit 2 is detected, but the destruction ring is
    too small to include unit 1.  Unit 1 is not marked for destruction, and so

    The movement rate from sheep units to cattle units is fixed at 1 shipment

    multiplier is 0 until the public is aware of the outbreak, then it

    The latent period lasts 1 day, infectiousness lasts 3 days, clinical signs
    accompany infectiousness immediately, and natural immunity lasts 3 days.

    There is no spread.
    
    The probability of detecting a diseased unit vs. the number of days the
    animals have been showing clinical signs is fixed at 1. The probability of
    detecting a diseased unit vs. the number of days since a public
    announcement of an outbreak is also fixed at 1.

    The authorities can begin a destruction program immediately.  The
    authorities will destroy units within 10 km of a detected unit.  On the
    first 4 days that destructions could occur, the destruction capacity will
    be zero.  The next day and forward, the destruction capacity is 1 unit per
    day.

    What should happen:
     - On day 1 unit 0 will be latent.
     - On day 2 unit 1 will be Infectious Clinical.  It will be detected, and
       unit 1 will be marked for destruction because it is within 10 km of a
       detected unit.
     - Day 3 is the first day that destructions could happen, but there will be
       no destruction capacity for 4 days.
     - On day 4 there will be no destruction capacity for another 3 days.
     - On day 5 unit 0 will no longer be infectious.  However, the simulation
       will keep going because there are still destruction tasks to be done.
       There will be no destruction capacity for another 2 days.
     - On day 6 there will be no destruction capacity for another 1 day.
     - On day 7 unit 1 will be destroyed.
     - On day 8 unit 1's state will show as Destroyed.  Because there are no
       infectious units left and nothing left to do, the simulation can end.

    In early exit tests 1-3, there are two units.  Unit 0 is infected.  On day
    1 unit 0 is detected and unit 1 is marked for destruction.  Different
    effects can be observed when a) there are resources to destroy unit 1
    immediately, b) there are no resources to destroy unit 1 at first, but
    resources eventually come on-line, or c) there are never resources to

    In this scenario, there are never resources to destroy unit 1.

    This is one of a set of 6 scenarios to check that the ring is drawn
