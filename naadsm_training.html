		<h2>NAADSM Training</h2>
		<p>The NAADSM training materials were developed for in-person epidemiological simulation modeling workshops
            offered in 2007 and 2008. These materials are provided as reference materials only. In some cases,
            working examples are referenced. It is not possible to provide all example materials as the file
            types are not supported.</p>
        <p>The NAADSM training materials were funded in part by cooperative agreements with the USDA.</p>

            How to add new documents to the Reference Database:
                Copy the following line and paste it in a newline ABOVE the "PASTE LINKS ABOVE THIS MARK" marker seen
                below. The link should show up in color and not as pure gray text. Then, replace text in square brackets
                in the "copy line" with the appropriate information.

                Copy line:
                    <li><a href="[document name]" target="_blank">[document title]</a></li>

                [document name] is NOT a file path, just a file name. For the one page info flyer, use
                "ADSM_OnePage_Info.flyer_101518_USAHA.docx.pdf"

                [document title] is RAW text input that will be shown directly to the user on the front end. The text in
                this title does NOT have to correlate to the document link.
