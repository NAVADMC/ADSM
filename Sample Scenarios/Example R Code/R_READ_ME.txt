NOTICE: The examples will be overwritten with every update of the ADSM software.
This update will allow additional R code to be added to the library in the future.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These Example R Code files are simple examples of how to use R with the ADSM database and supplemental files. 
The examples are not intended to answer every possible question that can be derived from the outputs.
Feel free to Save As, and modify the R code to suite your needs.

Occasionally, there are changes to the database that change the R Code. We will attempt to update
the code, but it is possible that some changes could be missed.  Feel free to modify based on the
error message that you are given.

There are R tutorials online.
