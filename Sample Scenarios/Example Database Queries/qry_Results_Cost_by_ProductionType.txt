--    Sample Query: Results Cost by production type
--    Date:         11/2/2018
--    By:           Schoenbaum, Missy
--
--    Notes: where clause 1=1 allows for easy editing of subsequent clauses
--             -- allows for line to be commented  (omitted)
--   This query calculates costs from the counts of units and animals
--   It is possible that rounding will be slightly different than the total cost that is calculated across all production type
