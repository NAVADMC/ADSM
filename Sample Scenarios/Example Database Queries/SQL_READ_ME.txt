NOTICE: The examples will be overwritten with every update of the ADSM software.
This update will allow additional queries to be added to the library in the future.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These Example Database Queries are simple examples of how to use SQL. 
The examples are not intended to answer every possible question that can be derived from the outputs.
Feel free to Save As, and modify the queries to suite your needs.

Occasionally, there are changes to the database that change the queries. We will attempt to update
the queries, but it is possible that some changes could be missed.  Feel free to modify based on the
error message that you are given.

There is a short SQL overview in the wiki. There are SQL tutorials online.
