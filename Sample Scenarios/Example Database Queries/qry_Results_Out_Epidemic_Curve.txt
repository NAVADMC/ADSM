--    Notes: where clause 1=1 allows for easy editing of subsequent clauses
--
--     Similar to outEpidemicCurve, missing count of infectious units and animals
--     I can't get to the workings that count through how many days a unit has
--     been infected by what mechanism of spread and what pdf they are using to move through
--     the day, so can't recreate.
