--     Notes: This query is close to the OutIteration table that is in NAADSM
--                where clause 1=1 allows for easy editing of subsequent clauses
--            -- allows for line to be commented  (omitted)
--             outbreakDuration = -1 means end didn't depend on control activities but on days or infection
