--      By:           Schoenbaum, Missy
--   -- allows for line to be commented  (omitted)
--      Notes: where clause 1=1 allows for easy editing of subsequent clauses
--                         
--      Naming Conventions are built with the following abbreviations - wiki provides more documentation
--      U = Unit  c - cumulative n - new I REMOVED ALL n NEW VARIABLES BECAUSE I AM ONLY GOING TO LOOK AT THE LAST 
--                                                          DAY OF THE OUTBREAK 
--      exp - exposure, from a contact method Air - airborn, Dir - direct or Ind - Indirect
--      inf - infection, which from a contact method Air - airborn, Dir - direct or Ind - Indirect
--      det - detection, from Clin - clinical exam or Test - testing
--
--    Here is a trick, onces you are sure you have correct results, make this into a VIEW, which saves it in the database you are working in
--    Add this command line to the top
--    CREATE TABLE myview AS  --MAKE SURE TO GIVE IT A NAME THAT IS DESCRIPTIVE and different if you have other views
--   When you run it, it will just give you a message it is complete, then you can refresh (Shift F5)
--   and  your new view will show up in the list to the left.  You can then export like a table, easier to manage
--   be sure to check box that first row contains column names
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- CREATE TABLE myview2 AS  -- see note above, leave off until needed

SELECT -- then list the fields that you want
iteration,
day,
r.production_type_id,  -- looking for null here, which is all prodution types
IFNULL(r.production_type_id, 'ALL') as production_type, -- I don't like leaving a blank, so I am going to give this a value of ALL and rename
last_day,
-- -------  Exposure by UNIT COUNTS
expcU,          -- NAMING EXAMPLE  Exposure Cumulative by Unit by all contact methods
expcUAir,     --Exposure Cumulative by Unit by airborne contact
expcUDir,    --Exposure Cumulative by Unit by direct contact
expcUInd,    --Exposure Cumulative by Unit by indirect contact
-- -------       Infection by Unit
infcU,          -- Infection Cumulative by Unit by all contact methods
infcUAir,     -- Infection Cumulative by Unit by airborne contact
infcUDir,     -- Infection Cumulative by Unit by direct contact
infcUInd,    -- Infection Cumulative by Unit by indirect contact
---------- Detection by Unit
detcU,             -- Detection Cumulative by Unit by all contact methods
detcUClin,      -- Detection Cumulative by Unit by Clinical exam
detcUTest      -- Detection Cumulative by Unit by testings
----------now the table where we get the data from
FROM  Results_dailybyproductiontype r
 -- Example of WHERE clause that allows us to limit results 
WHERE 1=1
AND r.production_type_id is null  -- THIS EMPTY MEANS IT IS THE LINE FOR THE COMBINED PRODUCTION TYPES
--AND iteration = 8  -- PICK AN ITERATION, in my example 8 was short but interesting
--AND last_day =1   -- REMOVING THIS TO SEE ALL DAYS  (0 false/1 true)
 -- Example of ORDER BY clause that allows us to sort results,  use desc to indicate descending
ORDER BY  iteration, day
