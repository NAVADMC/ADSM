--    Sample Query: Results Vaccination Queue (vaccination waiting)
--    Date:         9/10/2019
--    By:           Schoenbaum, Missy
--
--    Notes: It is important to understand how the Vaccination queue works to understand what these 
--    results mean. There are many input parameters determining when a vaccination is applied. 
--    In short, vaccination waiting variables may include duplicate records.
--
--    Units to vaccinate are identified when they fall into a vaccination ring, set on the Vaccination Ring tab. 
--    It is possible that a unit can fall into multiple vaccination rings, if multiple detected unit are in 
--    the surrounding area and triggering vaccination rings. Recall this is dependent on the production type 
--    of the triggering unit, the production type of the recipient unit and the radius of the vaccination ring. 
--    The identified unit then becomes a target (candidate) for vaccination and is put into the vaccination queue 
--    to wait for its turn to be vaccinated, based on the vaccination capacity set on the Vaccination Global form.
--
--    When filling the variables in the database, the target unit is counted in the vaccination waiting output data 
--    EVERY TIME it meets the criteria to be considered for vaccination. The vaccination queue could include duplicate units. 
--    As the simulation processes units that are waiting in the vaccination queue, it considered if each 
--    target unit is eligible for vaccination. At that point the simulation determines if a vaccination    
--    actually is applied to the target unit. The simulation considers if the target unit has 
--    already been vaccinated within the simulation (or set to V as the initial state from population file). 
--    If the target unit has been vaccinated, the simulation determines how many days have to pass 
--    before the unit can be vaccinated again, based on the minimum time between vaccination in the Control Protocol/Vaccination form. 
--    This parameter allows a unit to have a second vaccination (a “booster”) if necessary. 
--    The default value on minimum time between vaccination is set to 99,999 
--    to force a single vaccination within 99,999 days, unless the parameter is changed.  
--    Otherwise, minimum time between vaccination set to null or zero would allow the target unit to be 
--    immediately eligible for another vaccination every new day it appeared in the vaccination queue.
